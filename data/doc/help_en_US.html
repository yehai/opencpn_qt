<br>
This is the Documentation, for the OpenCPN 3.2 stable release.<br>
All serious users need to read through this document to fully understand
 the scope of the program, as well as all the details. If you have 
difficulties finding a particular subject, please use your browsers 
built in search ability, often called just "find".<br>
<br>
Press <img src="images/help.png" alt="" align="absMiddle"> and then the help tab to access this built in version of this document. Except for the table of contents, links in <em>italic</em> are internal to this document. Other links will need an Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/About32.png" alt="" height="362" width="600"><br>
<br>
The installed documentation will open in your default browser.<br>
To download a current snapshot of this wiki, as one huge web page, <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/ocpn_manual_export/">click here</a> (only works if you are on line).<br>
<br>
First before using OpenCPN, here is the note that all users has to approve when installing the program.</p>

<div class="rteindent1"><em>OpenCPN is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied<br>
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A<br>

See the GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN must only be used in conjunction with approved<br>
paper charts and traditional methods of navigation.<br>
<br>
DO NOT rely upon OpenCPN for safety of life or property.</em><br>
<br>
 </div>
<strong>Getting started using OpenCPN consists of 3 basic steps:</strong>

<ol>
	<li><a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN </em></a></li>
	<li><a href="#InstallingCharts"><em>Installing Charts</em> </a>to be read by OpenCPN</li>
	<li>*(Optional) <a href="#SettingUpGPS"><em>Setting Up GPS</em></a> to "talk" to your computer and OpenCPN</li>
</ol>
Completing these 3 steps will get you started and allow you to check out
 the program.  Later, after exploring the program, you may want to read 
through the <a href="#BasicFeatures"><em>Basic Features</em> </a>and <a href="#AdvancedFeatures"><em>Advanced Features</em> </a>sections
 to really get a good grasp of what the program offers.  If you still 
have questions or would just like to get in touch with other OpenCPN 
users, there is also a fairly large community behind OpenCPN. You can 
find us in this <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/">Cruisers Forum.</a><br>

<br>
If you are installing OpenCPN for the first time on a computer with 
Ubuntu, or any other Linux flavor, you have to go through a few steps to
 make sure that all dependencies are met. Ubuntu uses "deb" packages and
 Fedora uses the "rpm" packages.
<ul>
	<li>It is recommended that you install the "xcalib" program, that is 
necessary to dim the screen for night time usage. Use your favourite 
package manager or just issue <em>$sudo apt-get install xcalib </em>from the command line.</li>
	<li>On Ubuntu, start "System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Synaptic". In 
Synaptic  go to "Settings-&gt;Repositories" and tick the box 
"Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)". Close Synaptic.</li>
	<li>Download the correct .deb or .rpm from <a href="http://opencpn.org/download">Download OpenCPN</a>.</li>
	<li>Use the stable release for navigation en route, or if you just started using OpenCPN.</li>
	<li>Click on the downloaded package. An installation manager will guide
 you on most Linux distributions. All dependencies should automatically 
be installed. If you have problems with dependencies, run the 
recommended command line in the next paragraph.</li>
	<li>sudo gdebi<span> </span>&lt;downloaded_opencpn_file.deb&gt;. The command "gdebi" will automatically install the dependencies for you.</li>
	<li>It is also possible to install the package via dpkg or rpm, on the 
condition that all dependencies are met.To make sure that this is the 
case on Ubuntu, open a terminal window to get a command line, 
(Applications-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Terminal) and copy and paste the 
following line: "<em>sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0  libwxbase2.8-0 wx-common  libglu1-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx zlib1g bzip2 gpsd gpsd-clients </em><em>xcalib</em> <em>libportaudio2</em>". Then proceed with the commands below
	<ul>
		<li>
		<pre>For Ubuntu: $ sudo dpkg -i &lt;downloaded_file.deb&gt; 
For Fedora: # sudo yum install --nogpgcheck &lt;downloaded_file.rpm&gt;</pre>
		</li>
		<li>The binary will be installed to <strong>/</strong><strong>usr/local/bin/opencpn</strong> and the static data used by the program will be in <strong>/usr/local/share/opencpn  </strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If this is a new installation, click on the Options icon <img src="images/settings_003.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absMiddle"> and configure your GPS source, chart directories, and other settings.</li>
	<li>If there is a problem connecting the GPS to a physical port, such 
as /dev/ttyS0, make sure that you, as a user, belongs to the "dialout" 
group. To find out, run the "$groups" command. If you're not in 
"dialout", add yourself with "$sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER"</li>
	<li>If you are running Debian Squeeze and want to install OpenCPN from 
the distribution.deb package, you will need to install with something 
like this in order to satisfy install dependencies related to 
libtinyxml:<br>
	$sudo dpkg -i --force-depends opencpn_3.1.1327-1_i386.deb</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Currently other distributions requires compiling the source. This 
will involve resolving various dependencies and is for folks comfortable
 with developing on Linux.</li>
	<li>Download the source from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpn/files/opencpn/2.3.1/OpenCPN-2.3.1-Source.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net </a>or directly from the Git server.

<h3 id="DifferentversionsofOpenCPN">Different versions of OpenCPN</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Use a "stable", official release for actual navigation. The latest 
stable release is always available at the top of the download page or 
from Source Forge.</li>
	<li>Beta releases are snapshots of the development process, and may 
contain errors or temporarily be unstable. Show stoppers are normally 
fixed very quickly however. This is where the latest features first are 
seen. Most of the time the beta releases are quite stable and the 
OpenCPN team appreciate it if more experienced users test the releases 
and report back. The place to report bugs and suggest features is <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a>. To reach <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a> from the OpenCPN Web pages click on the "Tracker" tab at the upper right (above the blue bar).</li>
	<li class="rteleft">To see what version you are using either look in  
?-&gt;about or at the top of your display. A lot of information is also 
available in the log file. See below.<br>
	<br>

</ul>
 

<h3 id="Location of Important Files. Log and config files."><strong><a name="#"></a>Location of Important Files. Log and config files.</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li> It is important to know the location of the <strong>log file</strong> and the configuration file,<strong> opencpn.conf</strong>(Linux)<strong> </strong>or<strong> opencpn.ini</strong>
 (Windows), on your computer. If you ask questions on the forum, there 
is a fair chance that you will be asked about the content in these 
files. Once you get familiar with OpenCPN, have a look at the files!</li>
	<li>Through out this documentation there will be many references to the
 configuration file, as it often is possible to change the default 
settings. This is an advanced subject once you are familiar with 
OpenCPN. All editing in the config files must be done with a 
text-editor, such as "notepad" in Windows.</li>
	<li>The configuration file is where all data, that needs to be 
persistent between sessions, are stored. The logfile keeps tab of what's
 going on in the current session.                          </li>
	<li>To find the locations of the files go to the ToolBar click on 
"About OpenCPN", the button looks like a blue book with a "?" on the 
cover. Look at the bottom  of the "About" Tab, highlighted below. The 
illustration below is from a Win XP. A quick way to view the logfile is 
to copy the full file path and then paste this into the address field in
 a web browser.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="images/help_1.png" alt="" height="507" width="500"></li>
	<li>For quick copying of the opencpn.ini and Log files use the two 
"Copy" buttons. This is useful for publishing on the forum if asked to 
do so. Please use the Forum "Code" button  before pasting, as this 
guarantees an exact copy.</li>
	<li>On <strong>Linux</strong> the "opencpn.log" is in your home directory.<br>
	The "opencpn.conf" is in a hidden directory, called "opencpn", also in your home directory.<br>
	For a quick way to view the files you can try these commands.<br>
	$gedit `echo $HOME/opencpn.log`<br>
	$gedit `echo $HOME/.opencpn/opencpn.conf`<br>
	Of course you can swap "gedit" for your favorite editor.</li>
	<li>On <strong><strong>Windows 7, </strong>Windows 2000, XP and Vista </strong>the
 two files are more difficult to find, so use the "About" dialog as 
described above. On many windows installs the folder containing the 
logfile will also be <strong>hidden</strong>, so you need to change your systems "Folder Options" to show it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="rteindent1">For example, the C:\ProgramData folder is by default hidden in Windows 7. Here's how to get to it:<br>
<br>
To access it you need to un-hide it by doing the following:<br>
<br>
1. Go to <b>Control Panel &gt; Folder Options</b><br>
2. Switch to <b>View </b>tab<br>
3. Select "Show hidden files, folders and drives".<br>
4. Unselect "Hide extensions for know file types" to get this state:<img src="images/folderoptions.png" alt="" height="302" width="367"><br>
<br>
Now you will be able to find your logfile.<br>
 </div>

</ul>

<h3 id="Ifsomethinggoeswrong" class="rteindent1"><a name="#"></a>If something goes wrong</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div>If you have installed OpenCPN successfully and later run into 
trouble there is generally no point in reinstalling. It is a very common
 reaction among users, but achieves very little.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>First check your logfile and try to find a hint there.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>Next step is to close down OpenCPN, if it's still running. Then save any possibly valuable data. Read about <a href="#NavigationDataBackup"><em>Navigation Data Backup</em></a></div>
	</li>
	<li>Proceed by renaming the configuration file - opencpn.ini to , for 
example, opencpn_OLD.ini.  When you start OpenCPN again it will be like a
 new install, no chart directories and all settings are default.</li>
	<li>If you still have problems, and especially if your log file 
complains about navobj.xml files, close down OpenCPN and move all 
navobj.xml files to another directory. Rename the opencpn.ini file 
again, and then restart as before. If successful, close down again, and 
try to move, first the navobj.xml.1 back to the original directory 
renaming it navobj.xml. If not successful, try navobj.xml.2 etc This 
last step is only necessary if you have valuable data that's not saved 
elsewhere.</li>
	<li>
	<div>If this is successful, please post your old config file and your 
original navobj.xml file, together with full information of what 
happened, and your system, on the Cruisers Forum. To do this, first 
rename the file by adding ".doc" to the end of the file name.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>This will help the OpenCPN developers  to understand what's going on.</div>
	</li>
	<li>Still having trouble? Post a question to the <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/">Forum.</a></li>

<strong>What is OpenGL an Overview</strong><br>
OpenGL is an open standard, cross platform, advanced graphic library. It
  uses the graphic cards processor (GPU) and memory, to speed up 
applications.  With OpenCPN a user with a typical modern graphic card 
will have an enhanced experience. Much faster and smoother zooming and 
panning as well as clearer and sharper chart rendering.<br>
<br>
In OpenCPN OpenGL is a choice, the old graphic engine is still there. 
OpenGL will not work for everyone. Performance may not be improved with 
embedded graphics chips, often found in older laptops and netbooks.<br>
<br>
Microsoft has gone from support to hostility towards OpenGL. There is 
currently a lot of trouble with OpenGL on Vista and W7 for all OpenGL 
applications, not just OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="hps">Mac</span> <span class="hps">OS</span> <span class="hps">X</span> <span class="hps">has full</span> <span class="hps">supports</span> for <span class="hps">OpenGL</span><span>.</span></span><br>
<br>
For Linux the situation is slightly different. Linux supports OpenGL, as
 it generally tends to support open standards. The user is however 
dependent on a driver from the graphic cards maker, and their support 
for OpenGL. This may change with projects like <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/">nouveau</a>, a free driver for nVidias cards.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/nogl.png" alt="" height="167" width="200">        <img src="images/gl.png" alt="" height="172" width="200"><br>
Without OpenGL                         With OpenGL<br>
Heavy over zooming reveals some of the secrets behind OpenGL<br>
  <br>
<strong>Why introduce OpenGL in OpenCPN?<br>
</strong> The main reasons are:
<ul>
    <li><strong> </strong>Better performance, leveraging modern PC graphics cards that are ubiquitous and powerful.</li>
    <li>Better "eye candy", such as smooth zoom and pan, with little impact on responsiveness.</li>
    <li>Future cross-platform support (e.g Android/IOS)</li>
    <li>Some features depends on OpenGL, such as horizontal text and numbers on skewed (course up) vectorcharts.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Is OpenGL a good choice for everyone?</strong><br>
OpenCPNs performance with OpenGL is highly dependent upon your graphics hardware and drivers.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Some graphics chip sets (e.g.intel 945G) have rather   poor 
OpenGL driver support, so that we cannot fully utilize the hardware   
acceleration potential of these systems.</li>
    <li>nVidia graphics, even very old cards, seem to perform very well.</li>
    <li>Performance may not be improved with embedded graphics chips as often found in older laptops and netbooks.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of trouble with OpenGL on Vista and W7. Microsoft
 implemented a new screen compositing model for Vista and later, which 
"broke" many OpenGL apps</li>
    <li>Conclusion:Using OpenGL with OpenCPN will be a significant 
upgrade for some users of OpenCPN, but OpenGL may not be "better" for 
everyone's OCPN application.</li>
    <li>So, user's choice.  If OpenGL works better for you, then use it.
   If  not, the old DC based graphics render system is still in place,  
 with performance equivalent to Version 2.5.0.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Start using OpenGL</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Find the latest driver for your graphic card. The driver that

If you have a lot of graphic memory, or very little, try to add the following to your config (ini on windows) file:<br>
"GPUMemorySize=nnn"<br>
where nnn is graphics card memory size, in MBytes.<br>
256 MBytes is the default.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is an advanced subject. Beginners
 need only bother, if on a system with very low resources and if the 
system feels very sluggish. The background is that OpenCPN, quite 
aggressively uses memory, to speed up the application, this can backfire
 in certain situations....<br>
<br>
There is a simple memory management scheme, for use with systems that has limited resources.<br>
Two modes are available, only one of which can be active at any given 
time. The mode must be specified in the "opencpn.conf" file, called 
"opencpn.ini" in Windows and Mac.<br>
<br>
1.  Application memory limit target.  Try to limit the total memory used  by OCPN to the specified value, approximately.  <br>
Specify this mode by:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
MEMCacheLimit=xxx<br>
......<br>
Where xxx is memory use target in Mbytes.  Overrides NCacheLimit below.<br>
<br>
2.  Open chart limit.  This is the default mode under Linux, and the default value is 20 open charts at any one time.<br>
<br>
Modify this limit by the following:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
NCacheLimit=yy<br>
......<br>
Where yy is the maximum number of simultaneously open charts.<br>
<br>
If you do not enter any memory management specification in the config file, the following defaults apply:<br>
<br>
a.  Linux... behavior is the same as previous versions, Open chart limit is 20 charts.<br>
b.  Windows and Mac...Application memory limit target is used.  Target 
limit is 50% of available physical RAM, up to a maximum of 1 gigabyte.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The OpenCPN portable option allows the
 program to run fron an USB stick, or run independent from and parallel

To differ between various instances of the program, the titlebar on portable versions looks like this.<br>
<img src="images/portable.png" alt="" height="31" width="605"> <br>
It is thus possible to run multiple portable instances and identify each version.<br>
<br>
<h3 id="TocreateaportableWindowsversion">To create a portable Windows version</h3>
<br>
The following files/directories/folders must be in the directory containing the OpenCPN executable:<br>
<br>
1.  OpenCPN.exe (of course)<br>
2.  "opencpn portable.bat" (or other name of user choice)<br>
A MSDOS batch file containing the one line:<br>
"opencpn -p"<br>
3.  msvcr100.dll<br>
4.  msvcp100.dll<br>

To run OpenCPN portably within this directory, simply execute the  
"opencpn portable" batch file. There may be a way to build a click-able 
 shortcut to OpenCPN, with the -p option specified in the shortcut. But I
  could not figure it out.  Windows insists upon a drive letter in the  
command line of the shortcut, which would defeat the whole purpose of  
portability.<br>
Thus, the batch file....<br>
If the charts are also in the current dir, then the entire installation 
is "portable", meaning there are no hard-coded drive letter 
dependencies, and all write activities occur in the current dir only.<br>
I find that this works pretty well from a USB stick...<br>
<br>
<h3 id="ALinuxversion">A Linux version</h3>
<br>
On Linux, a similar functionality exists.<br>
Copy the opencpn executable binary and the data directories mentioned above to a local directory.<br>
In that directory, do<br>
$ ./opencpn -p<br>
This will cause all user data files to be created and used from within that local directory.<br>
This can be useful for side-by-side testing...<br>

<strong><br>
OpenCPN </strong>does<strong> </strong>not come with any pre-installed charts<strong>. </strong>It is up to the user to find and install charts<strong>. </strong>Read
 on, and you will find detailed information about which chart formats 
that OpenCPN can display, as well as pointers to all available free 
charts that we know of. <br>
<br>
<strong>Background Chart</strong>. OpenCPN comes with a worldwide background map, displayed if no charts are available for an area.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/BGchart.png" alt="" height="568" width="750"><br>
<br>
To install charts, OpenCPN must be pointed to a directory containing Charts of one of the recognized  <a href="#ChartFormats"><em><strong>Chart Formats</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Don't point OpenCPN to individual charts. You must specify the directory that contains the charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where do I keep my charts ?</strong><br>
The installation tells you to go to the Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Loaded Charts tab to install charts.<br>
The top of the tab, "Available Chart Directories" is showing "My 
Documents" for Windows, and the users home directory, for Linux and Mac.
 These are good places to keep your charts. Create a "Chart" directory, 
and maybe some sub directories, to keep your charts in, and you can't go
 far wrong.<br>
Seasoned users knows where they want their charts.<br>
Regard charts as data, independent of OpenCPN. Store them in a place 
that is convenient for you and that is left alone by the operating 
system.<br>
Download some charts (see <a href="#ChartSources"><em>Chart Sources</em></a>) to your newly created Chart directory. Follow the directions below to make this directory an "Active Chart Directory"<br>
<br>
The main consideration for charts is  storing them in a directory where they will not be tampered with or moved accidentally.<br>
<br>
<strong>Installing Charts</strong><br>
Open the Options Dialog by clicking <img src="images/settings_003.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">.  You are sent to the first tab "Display". Tick the box "Show Chart Outlines". That will help you visualize the loaded charts.<br>
  <br>
<img src="images/options-display.png" alt="" height="537" width="600"><br>
<br>
Then click the tab "Charts" and then the tab "loaded Charts".<br>
<br>
<img src="images/charts_MT.png" alt="" height="697" width="600"><br>
<br>
There are no charts loaded. To add charts we have to add a directory 
that contains charts of a recognized format. To get started press "Add 
Directories" and navigate to your chart-directory. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/add-Chart.png" alt="" height="447" width="600"><br>
<br>
Exactly how the dialog looks like depends on your operating system, and is not a part of the core OpenCPN. <br>
When clicking the button "Open" above,  the highlighted chart directory 
is added to  the  box "Directories". The screen-shots are from Linux, 
but this process works similarly on all platforms. Add more chart 
directories using the same process again. It's OK to load both raster- 
and vector-charts together.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/add-Chart1.png" alt="" height="401" width="600"><br>
<br>
All that remains is to click the "Apply" button. OpenCPN will then 
process your selection. You can now start using your charts. When you 
are done with your settings click "OK" and the Options Dialog closes. If
 you are just adding a chart directory, it works fine to just click the 
"Ok" button. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Note that in OpenCPN you must add directories (folders) containing charts, not the individual charts.</u></strong><br>
<br>
For <strong>BSB4</strong> and <strong>nv-charts</strong>, first install the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/downloadplugins">latest plugin version</a>, then point OpenCPN to the correct chart directories and finally do a "Full Database Rebuild".<br>
<br>
<strong>Eager to get some charts quickly, to get started?</strong> Go to:  <a href="#ChartSources"><em>Chart Sources</em></a><br>
<br>
<strong>Start using your charts</strong>.<br>
You can click and drag the chart with your mouse. The cursor changes to 
an triangular green arrow near the edges of the OpenCPN window, left 
clicking in this situation, pans the chart in the direction of the 
arrow. The scroll wheel zooms in and out. Left clicking anywhere centers
 the view on that position. Right clicking brings up a menu with useful 
actions. Exactly what the menu contains depends on the circumstances. 
Read the rest of the manual for a full explanation.<br>
<br>
If you are running OpenCPN for the first time you may see the background
 chart instead of the charts you installed.  That simply means OpenCPN 
is pointed at a location that is not on any of the charts you installed.
  Click and drag, or use the arrow keys, to move the view-point to the  
location of one of your installed charts as described under "<strong>A few hints</strong>"
 below. Look for the rectangular outlines of the installed charts. An 
alternative is to right-click, and then click "Jump to position". Enter a
 location that is within the perimeters of your entered charts. The 
first time you start OpenCPN the view will be centered on Georgetown in 
South Carolina.<br>
<br>
<strong>Single Chart Mode</strong> is the default display mode. In this 
mode only one chart at a time will be displayed. All the information 
printed outside the chart proper can be read. To change to another 
chart, select and click in the Chart Selection Bar. Read more in <a href="#StatusBar"><em>Status Bar</em></a>. The other display mode is <a href="#ChartQuilting"><em>Chart Quilting</em></a><em>.</em><br>
<br>
<div class="rteleft"><strong>Starting with vector charts?</strong></div>
If you are new to vector charts, including CM93 v2, on OpenCPN follow this quick-start guide:<br>
<br>
1 Go to Options <img src="images/settings_002.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">-&gt;Charts-&gt; Vector Charts and copy the settings below for the Display Category.<br>
<br>
<div class="rteleft"><img src="images/initial-vector.png" alt="" height="385" width="233"></div>
<br>
2 Press this button <img src="images/text.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> in the ToolBar to toggle text display. Alternatively, the "T" hotkey does the same thing.<br>
<br>
These are not the perfect settings, but you will see most of what you expect from a vector chart.<br>
As soon as you have made yourself reasonably comfortable with OpenCPN 
and before using Vector Charts for actual navigation, make sure you 
understand all the settings in the Options-&gt; Charts -&gt; Vector 
Charts Tab by reading the <a href="#VectorCharts"><em>Vector Charts</em></a> page.<strong><br>
Loading Vector Charts</strong><br>
When using a vector chart for the first time, OpenCPN has to process the
  data, and transform the information to an internal display format. 
This  can take some time, depending on your computer. This internal SENC
 chart, is saved for future use. The created files are quite large, but 
is in a format optimized for quick loading. OpenCPN is trading, creation
 time and size, for fast rendering when actually using the vector chart.
 The SENC files are saved in the SENC directory, in the same place as 
the opencpn.conf file - opencpn.ini on windows.<br>
You probably do not want to build SENCs for all of your loaded S57 ENCs unless you plan to actually go there....<br>
For an advanced approach to building SENC files <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/troubleshooting#init">look here.</a><br>
<strong>Updating Vector Charts</strong><br>
Publishers of Vector Charts, such as NOAA and EAHC issues regular 
updates. OpenCPN updates the created SENCs automatically. The chart 
itself, the base-chart, is named "name".000 , the first update is 
"name".001 and so on. As a user you only have to make sure that the 
update files are saved in the same place as the base-chart. In the case 
of a new edition of the chart a new "name".000 file is issued. Just 
replace the old file with the new file and OpenCPN will update the SENC 
file. Don't forget to remove the updates to the old edition of the 
chart.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 Charts</strong><br>
CM93-version2 Charts are different from the S57 vector charts, and has 
it's own data structure consisting of a number of folders and files. To 
load these charts in OpenCPN just add the top directory to the list of 
"Active Chart Directories".<br>
In the top CM93 directory is an empty file with the ".EXD", for example 
20110803.EXD. The format is YYYYMMDD.EXD. This is the version, or 
edition, of the CM93 -v2 release.<br>
OpenCPN supports partial CM93 datasets, covering one or a few of the 
available regions. There is also support for multiple, as well 
asmultiple partial, cm93 datasets.<br>
The CM93 top directory contains a number of (144) subdirectories named from<br>
"00300000" to "04501020", as well as six other files. These sub 
directories each cover a geographical area of 40° x 40° . The first four
 numbers describes the latitude and the last four, the longitude of the 
SW corner of the area covered.<br>
The key to understanding the numbers is to realize that CM93's coordinate system<br>
of the world starts at the South Pole or to be exact at lat -90° long 0° and from there<br>
proceeds North a East with a factor of 3 for each degree of lat and long.<br>
The tile 00300000 hence has the SW corner at lat from -90° + 0030:3 = -80° or 80°S to<br>
and longitude  0°E , and covers the area from 80°S latitude to 40°S and from 0° longitude to 40°E.<br>
Looking at 04501020 it brakes down to lat -90° + 0450:3 = 60° and long 
1020:3 = 340° subtracting 360° results in -20° or 20°W. So we have he SW
 corner at 60°N and 20°W .<br>
One more example, the tle 03900840 has the SW corner at 40°N and 80°W.<br>
<br>
Each of these sub-directories in turn contains directories with the 
individual charts. Ordered in scale from smallest to largest they are 
Z,A,B,C,D,E,F and G. Where Z contains  overview charts and G contains 
harbor plans. Note that, generally, not all of these are present in each
 subdirectory.<br>
<br>
Z covers 40° x 40° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3.000.000 scale<br>
A covers 20° x 20° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:1.000.000 scale<br>
B covers 10° x 10° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:200.000 scale<br>
down to<br>
..<br>
G covers 20' x 20' and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3500 scale.<br>
The individual chart tiles in these directories have the same logic in the naming scheme as described above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>A few hints. </strong>      <br>
<ul>
    <li>If you ticked the "Show Chart Outlines" box under the "Display" 
tab the loaded charts will be outlined in red for raster and green for 
vector charts. In CM93 the charts will be outlined in purple. The 
smallest scale charts in CM93, the Z scale and A scale charts, will not 
be outlined. Neither will all available charts be visible as outlines at
 the same time. The reason for this is computing speed and clarity. 
Generally the next level or two of larger scale charts are shown. When 
large scale plans are available directly from A scale charts, with no 
intermediate charts, the outline of the larger scale charts will be 
visible from a zoom level between 1.5 and 2.0 but only in single chart 
mode and with chart outlines switched on. Generally in areas where only A
 or Z scale charts are available, expect potentially dangerous 
omissions. <strong>Warning</strong>, do not use CM93 small scale charts alone for navigation without referring to other sources.</li>
    <li>Be aware that it is possible to "Over-zoom" charts in OpenCPN. A
 warning will appear on the display. Please respect that warning. It is 
recommended to not zoom more than a factor 2, for safe navigation. The 
actual zoom-factor appears in the lower right-hand corner of the display
 in single mode chart display.</li>
    <li>It is safe and reasonably efficient to put all your charts <strong>except </strong>the
 CM93 database in one large directory, and set that directory in 
Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Loaded Charts. The CM93 database contains its own
 file and directory structure. The top-level directory only, of this 
database, should be loaded, as described above.<br>
    If you do a lot of chart downloads, updates, etc., then it will be 
faster to break the charts folder into smaller groups, and specify them 
individually in the Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Loaded Charts dialog. 
Consider using <a href="#ChartGroups"><em>Chart Groups</em></a></li>
    <li>"<strong>Scan Charts and Update Database </strong>" Use this 
option if you have made any changes to the contents of your  chart 
directories, as for example after downloading new charts from  NOAA, 
etc. It need not be checked if directories are added or subtracted, as 
the  entire database will be scanned and updated automatically in this 
case.</li>
    <li>"<strong>Force Full Database Rebuild</strong>" is mainly aimed 
at users converting or correcting existing charts, in a situation where 
changes are made to the geo-referencing, outline of the chart, or other 
attributes in the kap file header section.</li>
    <li>OpenCPN,  supports  <strong>Mercator Charts, Transverse Mercator Charts, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Charts and Polyconical Charts</strong>
 (used in parts of US and Canada). Charts using other projections will 
not be displayed. A note about the reason for the display refusal, will 
be found in the "opencpn.log".  <br>
    "Other" projections could be <strong>Lamberts Conformal Conic Projection</strong>, mainly used in high latitude polar areas.<strong> </strong><strong> Gnomonic</strong>
 charts, mainly used in older, larger scale BA charts, for smaller 
areas, for example harbor plans, in scales larger than 1:50,000. Newer 
editions of these charts are generally re-issued as Transverse Mercator 
charts. Gnomonic projection charts are also traditionally used for Great
 Circle Sailings. Such charts are not needed in OpenCPN, as 
Great-circles are handled internally.  <br>
     </li>
    <li>OpenCPN is <strong>not</strong> suited for Polar Navigation N/S of about 70 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<strong>A Linux/Unix Note</strong><br>
These operating systems have a <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html">problem</a>
 handling chart names containing spaces and non ASCII characters. A 
typical example is Swedish chart names. To sort this out use the utility
 program <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/detox">"detox</a>". Detox changes the file names so space becomes "_"; "(" and ")" become "-"; and "å","ä" and "ö" become "a","a" and "o", etc.<br>
<br>
To see what "detox" suggests to do, try a dry run first, like this:<br>

<br>
Note that the extensive use of the cheap gps mouse BU-353 as an example below, should only be seen as an illustration. <br>
<br>
<p>To use OpenCPN with a GPS, a GPS receiver is needed.</p>
<p>There are a variety of possible choices for a GPS receiver:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A computer, such as a Sony Vaio P has a built in GPS receiver</li>
    <li>A NMEA Expander to amplify a nmea stream to multiple listeners</li>
    <li>A hand-held GPS receiver</li>
    <li>A dedicated GPS receiver</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this section describes using OpenCPN with a 
dedicated GPS receiver, however, the instructions for a dedicated 
receiver will be similar for any serial/USB connected NMEA data stream.</p>
<h4 id="ADedicatedGPSReceiver">A Dedicated GPS Receiver</h4>
<p>There are several companies making dedicated GPS receivers. The 
Supplementary Hardware section for GPS devices lists several 
manufacturers.</p>
<p>NMEA has traditionally been implemented as a serial protocol and 
therefore, even if a USB connection is used, there needs to be a USB to 
Serial Port conversion. The specific driver for the each GPS receiver 
will handle this conversion.<br>
 </p>
<h4 id="An Example - Configuring BU-353">An Example - Configuring BU-353</h4>
<p> It is not necessary to use the installation disk to setup the 
BU-353. Following the steps listed below will result in the latest 
driver being installed.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the latest driver from Prolific - <a href="http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A" title="http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A">http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A</a></li>
    <li>Unzip and install the driver</li>
    <li>Plug in the BU-353.</li>
    <li>Start -&gt; (Right Click) My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Hardware -&gt;Device Manager <br>
    or Start-&gt;Run devmgmt.msc</li>
    <li>Expand Ports</li>
    <li>Look for the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port” and note the com port number (e.g., COM4) <img src="images/DeviceManager-1.jpg" alt="" align="textTop" height="610" width="410"></li>
     
    <li>Right click on the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port”. Choose Driver</li>
    <li>Select 4800 bits per second, 8 data bits, None parity, 1 stop bit, and None for Flow Control  <img src="images/Prolific.jpg" alt="" align="textTop" height="450" width="410"></li>
     
    <li>Start OpenCPN</li>
    <li>Click on the Options Icon  <img src="images/settings_003.png" alt="Toolbox Settings"></li>
    <li>Select "Connections", and "Add Connection" and "Serial"</li>
    <li>Under "Data Port" select the Com port noted in #6</li>
    <li>Choose OK</li>
    <li>Select Auto Follow to center the map over your GPS location</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>There is a small LED located on the BU-353. If the LED is off there is no power being received. Check the connection.</p>
<p>If the LED is solid it indicates the BU-353 is searching for a GPS signal. Try moving the GPS receiver to a clear location.</p>
<p>If the LED is flashing it indicates the BU-353 has a position fix and is transmitting data.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Try viewing the NMEA data stream in OpenCPN. Choose Options-&gt;Connections-&gt;Show NMEA Debug Window</li>
    <li>Alternatively, a diagnostic program is included on the 
installation CD called GPSInfo.exe. Launch this program to install the 
diagnostic utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it appears that the NMEA data stream is being received, the most 
likely issue is that OpenCPN is not centered over your location. Click 
AutoFollow to center the map at your GPS location.</p>
<h4 id="KnownIssues">Known Issues</h4>
<p>If you change the USB port for the GPS receiver Prolific will 
reassign the COM port number. This will require repeating steps 4-12 
above.</p>
<p>On some computer / GPS receiver combinations when the computer 
resumes from Stand By the GPS receiver will no longer transmit its NMEA 
data stream, and only garbage instead of ASCII characters will be 
visible in the NMEA Data Stream Window. The red indicator led will not 
work.<br>
<br>
To change back to NMEA mode search for and download SIRFDemo.exe.<br>
Unpack and start. Set correct Baud rate and and com port as above.<br>

<p>To proceed, the "user" you use on your computer must belong to the <strong>group "dialout"</strong>.<br>
Check your status by writing "groups" on a command line. The response 
will be all groups that the user belongs to. Make sure that "dialout" is
 included. If not, you have to add your user to this group. There are 
many ways to do this, one is to issue this command:<br>
"sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER"<br>
This applies to many Debian based distibutions, for other distros just drop the sudo and do the command as root, using "su".<br>
All major Linux distribution includes a graphical user settings dialog, where adding a user to a group, could be fixed.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Install the gpsd and gpsd-clients packages<br>
    <ul>                  $ sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Go to Options-&gt; Connections-&gt; Add Conection and select
 "Network" plus the   GPSD radio button. Address should be "localhost" 
and DataPorts should be set to 2947.</li>
        <li>On Ubuntu 10.04 and later, that is really all you have to do. When you plug in your gps this will trigger gpsd to start.</li>
        <li>"xgps" is client that comes with the gpsd-clients package, 
and is useful for testing that the gps and gpsd is working properly. If 
xgps isn't working, it's a gps or gpsd problem, not an OpenCPN problem</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="Direct connection.">Direct connection.</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> Make sure that gpsd isn't running then connect your gps and
 start OpenCPN. On Ubuntu 12.04 the easiest way to achive this is to 
unistall gpsd.</li>
        <li>In the Options-&gt;Connections -&gt; Add Conection, select 
"Serial".Set "dataPort to the  port where you plugged in your gps. If 
you plugged in BU  353 this will probably be /dev/ttyUSB0.</li>
        <li>Choose 4800 baud, unless you know that the gps is set to something else.</li>
        <li>The gps should now work....if not, check the NMEA data  
stream window. If only binary garbage is visible, the gps has to be  
reset to NMEA mode, see more about this above in windows section. An 
alternative is to use gpsd, that will work with the gps in Sirf mode.</li>
        <li>To do this in Linux for BU 353 as well as many other  
gps:es, make sure that gpsd is running  and that the package  
"gpsd-clients" is installed. On Ubuntu 12.04 gpsd needs to be 
temporarily installed. Make sure to kill any instances of gpsd with the 
command "sudo killall gpsd"</li>
        <li>The command $gpsctl -n will put the GPS into NMEA mode.</li>
        <li>If that doesn't work, try $ gpsctl -f -n  /dev/ttyUSB0 .This
 will force a low-level access, bypassing gpsd. For more information: 
$man gpsctl</li>
        <li>More information is as always available through "man gpsctl" Close down OpenCPN before running gpsctl.<br>
                   <br>
        None of this is normally noticed when using gpsd, as this program reads both NMEA and SIRF binary sentences.</li>

    If you have a bluetooth GPS  you will need to first configure it  
through the standard Ubuntu Bluetooth "set up new device " proceedure. 
Once you have done that you will need to find what the address of the 
GPS is. To do that you run this command:<br>
    <br>
    "sudo hcitool scan"<br>
    <br>
    it will then start looking for the Bluetooth GPS and hopefully find your GPS. You should see something similar to:<br>
    <br>
    Scanning ...<br>
        00:1C:88:10:D3:4D    iBT-GPS<br>
    <br>
    In this case i have a IBT-GPS at address     00:1C:88:10:D3:4D   (Your GPS address will be different)<br>
    <br>
    Next we have to bind the GPS address to a "virtual" device OpenCPN 
understands in this case rfcomm0. We do this with the following command:<br>
    <br>
    sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D        Note put your GPS address in this line<br>
    <br>
    You should not have to run these commands  each time your linux is restarted as it will remeber your GPS address.<br>
    <br>
    Now all you need to do is go into OpenCPN Toolbox and select GPS. 
Now in the NMEA Data Source options select from the pulldown menu: 
"/dev/rfcomm0", or write it in the box, if not present as an 
alternative.<br>
    <br>
    Thats it - you should now have a Bluetooth GPS Connected.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ubuntu</strong><strong> 12.04</strong><br>
    -Pair GPS with bluetooth icon<br>
    -break connection with bluetooth icon<br>
    -get device id: sudo hcitool scan<br>
    -get channel for gps: sdptool records 00:02:78:0A:4E:E9 (put your actual number here)<br>
    -sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf  #edit rfcomm input file. Text should be:<br>
    <pre>	#
	# RFCOMM configuration file.
	#
	# $Id: rfcomm.conf,v 1.1 2002/10/07 05:58:18 maxk Exp $
	#

	rfcomm0 {
	        # Automatically bind the device at startup
	        bind yes;

	        # Bluetooth address of the device
	        device xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;

	        # RFCOMM channel for the connection
	        channel 1;#use channel number as provided by sdptool records XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

	        # Description of the connection
	        comment "Your GPS Device Here";
	}</pre>
    - sudo rfcomm release 0 (not strictly neccesary)<br>
    - sudo rfcomm connect 0 (you only need to to this once, not required if you reboot at this point)<br>
    ...connected /dev/rfcomm0 to 00:00:00:00:00:00 (whatever)<br>
    ...Press CTRL-C for hangup<br>
    in a seperate terminal, you can test the connection with rfcomm show /dev/rfcomm0<br>
    ...rfcomm0: 00:08:1B:14:18:B6 channel 1 connected [tty-attached]<br>
    your bluetooth GPS should now be working in open CPN. run sudo 
opencpn to check that it works (/dev/rfcomm0 under GPS NMEA data 
source). <br>
    if it works, try  running opencpn without sudo, chances are that you
 cannot see the gps. if this is the case, use the following fix: sudo 
usermod -a -G dialout $USER<br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="Fedora">Fedora</h4>
    Run "hcitool scan" to get the ID of your bluetooth gps device<br>
    Make a file "rfcomm.config" and put it in /etc/bluetooth.<br>
    This file is already present in Ubuntu, but needs editing for persistent connection.<br>
    <br>
    # RFCOMM configuration file.<br>
    #<br>
    # $Id: rfcomm.conf,v 1.1 2002/10/07 05:58:18 maxk Exp $<br>
    #<br>
    rfcomm0 {<br>
    # Automatically bind the device at startup<br>
    bind yes;<br>
    # Bluetooth address of the device<br>
    device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX;<br>
    # RFCOMM channel for the connection<br>
    channel 1;<br>
    # Description of the connection<br>
    comment "Your GPS Device Here";<br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    Change XX:XX:XX.... to your device ID<br>
    <br>
    Open Opencpn and write /dev/rfcomm0 as GPS NMEA device. Note that 
you can add it yourself by writing directly into the scroll down box.<br>
    Permissions for /dev/rfcomm0 are for group "dialout". Make sure you belong to that group.<br>
    The command "groups" will show all the groups you belong to.<br>
    Make sure that "gpsd" isn't running, issuing "killall gpsd" as root.<br>

    <br>
    Attaching a GPS device to a Mac is done via one of the USB ports. 
Whether using a device with its own USB lead or via a serial-USB adapter
 lead or an NMEA multiplexer with USB port, the appropriate OS X driver 
needs to be installed. Nearly all hardware uses one of just two chip 
makes: those from FTDI or Prolific. Both those companies make OS X 
drivers available on their web sites, but manufacturers of GPS devices 
usually package the driver with device.<br>
    <br>
    When the driver is installed and the device connected, start 
OpenCPN, select the Toolbox and click the GPS tab. Open the "NMEA Data 
Source" menu &amp; select the the device from the list. It is not always
 obvious which is the correct one, but in general the device will have a
 name starting: "/dev/cu." or "/dev/tty.". Some manufacturers make it 
obvious, like "/dev/cu.MiniPlex-99000125", but others may be more 
generic, like: "/dev/cu.usbserial". Set the "NMEA Baud Rate" to 4800 and
 click "OK". If the correct selection has been made, you should see the 
GPS status icon change from red to green.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->OpenCPN uses some basic settings or limitations.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Courses are always true, not magnetic .</li>
    <li>Distances are measured in Nautical Miles (meters for very short distances, less than a cable ~ 183 m).</li>
    <li>All distances and routes are calculated using Mercator Sailing. Great Circle Sailing is an oprion in route creating.</li>
    <li>Knots is used for speed. m/s is an option in displaying GRIB files</li>
</ul>
These fundamental settings cannot be changed.<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Only edit to the opencpn.ini (opencpn.conf) file when OpenCPN isn't running</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Let's take a look at some of OpenCPN's basic features.<br><!-- google_ad_section_end -->  <div id="node-15" class="section-3">
  <h1 id="ToolbarButtons" class="book-heading">Toolbar Buttons</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>The Toolbar is floating and can be placed anywhere on the screen, vertical or horizontal.<br>
Note the "grabber" symbol at the far right side of the toolbar. Use this
 handle to drag the toolbar wherever you want it. The default position 
is horizontal and docked top left.<br>
It "snaps" to the edges. Right click on the grabber, and the toolbar 
shifts to vertical format. On Windows (at least), unless in OpenGL 
display mode, the toolbar dims down transparently until you roll over 
it.<br>
<br>
There are three different styles of Toolbars to choose from. Go to the 
ToolBox-&gt;"User interface"-&gt; "Toolbar and Window Style" and select 
one of the following styles:<br>
<br>
Traditional<br>
<img src="images/trad-tool.png" alt="" height="41" width="700"><br>
Journeyman<br>
<img src="images/jman-tool.png" alt="" height="34" width="700"><br>
Journeyman Flat<br>
<img src="images/jman-flat-tool.png" alt="" height="36" width="700"></p>

<p><br>
There are a lot of buttons available in the standard Toolbar, even more,
 counting the many plugins. To control exactly which buttons to display,
 hold the cursor over any button and right-click. This dialog pops up.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/buttons-select.png" alt="" height="403" width="450"><br>
<br>
Only the buttons with a ticked box will be displayed. The available 
shortcuts are also shown in parenthesis to the right of the button 
description.<br>
<strong>The MOB button is special</strong>. If unticked, you will get these choices:<br>
<br>
<img src="images/MOB-choice.png" alt="" height="178" width="500"><br>
<br>
<strong>#1:</strong> The MOB button will still be there, but anyone (crew?) may later hide it.<br>
<br>
<strong>#2:</strong> If OpenCPN is used to handle a MOB situation, 
choose this option. The MOB button will always be there. It is not 
possible to change the state as long as OpenCPN is running. The MOB 
button option will not even appear in the right-click menu.<br>
To reset this option open the opencpn.ini(config) file and change the value below from<br>
"1" to "0". Restart and all the options are once again available.<br>
"[Settings]<br>
....<br>
PermanentMOBIcon=1"<br>
<br>
<strong>#3: </strong>Use this option if a MOB situation is handled by 
other means, and OpenCPN is not a part of the standard operational MOB 
procedure.<br>
<br>
The visibility of the plugin buttons is controlled in the ToolBox-&gt;Plugins Tab, by pressing the Enable/Disable toggle button.<br>
<br>
Note that the Toolbar must have at least one active button.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/last-button.png" alt="" height="119" width="400"><br>
<br>
<br>
When a toggle button is pressed, it changes and becomes darker, 
Traditional style also adds a stronger outer frame. For example, 
tracking off <img src="images/track_off.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="41" width="40">, tracking  on <img src="images/track-pressed.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="43" width="42">.<br>
<br>
A brief explanation of the use of each button is available by just hovering with the cursor<br>
<br>
over a button. <img src="images/explain.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="53" width="163"><br>

  <h1 id="RightClickMenu" class="book-heading">Right Click Menu</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The right click menu is always 
available as long as the cursor is somewhere in the chart area. The 
content of this menu is very context sensitive. The reason for the  
"Focused Context Menus", is to keep the number of options down to a 
reasonable level, and still be able to deal with all situations. There 
are basic right-click menus when clicking at a random point, and very 
focused menus when clicking on a waypoint, a route, a track or an AIS 
target. If you have just created or deleted a waypoint, or if chart 
groups are defined, there are further entries added to the basic menu.  
Below, the basic entries are explained.The more context specific entries
 are dealt with as the concerned feature is explained.  <br>
<br>
<h3 id="The basic single charts right-click menus.">The basic single charts right-click menus.</h3>
Below is first the rastercharts menu to the left and then the vector chart menu.<br>
Available "hotkeys", if any, are shown to the right.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/base_raster_single.png" alt="" align="top" height="302" hspace="5" width="251"><img src="images/base_vectot_single1.png" alt="" height="273" hspace="10" width="282"><br>
<br>
Starting with the left menu for rastercharts.<br>
<h5 id="Measure">Measure</h5>
Activates a "pencil". Move the pencil with the cursor. Put the tip of  
the pencil on a position that you want to measure from. Left-click, a  
dot Position with a circle around is created. Move the pencil with the 
mouse and  see the distance and bearing from the point to the pencil-tip
 in "real  time". Left-clicking again creates a temporary waypoint. When
 moving the  "pencil" again, distance and bearing, once again are shown 
from the  temporary waypoint. The total distance from the original 
measure point,  via the temporary wapoint(s) are also shown as "Route 
Distance". Right  click and mark "Measure Off" to stop measuring.<br>
For longer distances, specially on east.west courses on higher 
latitudes, the measure tool seamlessly switches to display and measure 
great circles instead of Mercator rhumb-lines. Read more <a href="#Great-circleSailing"><em>Great-circle Sailing</em></a> .<br>
The  "Create Route" tool works in a similar way, but you can't use the two tools at the same time.<br>
<h5 id=""><br>

<br>
<h5 id="MaxDetailHere">Max Detail Here</h5>
Displays  the largest scale, most detailed chart,<strong> </strong>available in the position of the cursor.<br>
It is assumed that there are more than one chart available at the position.<br>

<strong>Drop Mark Here</strong>. Drops a mark in the position of the cursor. Further explained on this page::<a href="#MarksandRoutes"><em>Marks and Routes</em></a><br>
<br>
<h5 id="MoveBoatHere">Move Boat Here</h5>
Moves own boats position to the position pointed at. This item is only  
 visible in the right click-menu if the GPS isn't connected. <br>
<br>
<strong>Navigate to here</strong><br>
Creates an instant active route from own boat to the position clicked. More about routes:<a href="#MarksandRoutes"> <em>Marks and Routes</em></a><br>
<br>
<strong>Center View...</strong><br>
Activates a small dialog where latitude and longitude can be entered.   
Pressing "OK" centers the display on this position, keeping the same   
scale. If a position has been copied, and is in your copy buffer, it  
will be displayed as default values. OpenCPN accepts a wide variety of  
position formats. The values entered is  kept during a session, but goes
  when restarting OpenCPN. <br>
<br>
<h5 id="CourseUpMode">Course Up Mode</h5>
Is shown because we are in North Up Mode. Clicking this entry changes  
the display to "North Up  Mode." It is a toggle switch between "North  
Up" and "Course Up". Read more about display orientation: <a href="#AutoFollowandDisplayOrientation"><em>Auto Follow and Display Orientation</em></a><br>
<br>
<strong>AIS Target List</strong><br>
Shows a list of discovered AIS targets, if any. Read more on the <a href="#AIS"><em>AIS</em></a><em> </em> page.<br>
<br>
Looking at the right click menu for vector charts, to the right above,we can see these additional entries.<br>
<br>
<h5 id="ObjectQuery">Object Query</h5>
Every point on a vector-chart has certain attributes, or information.   
This can vary from just the depth in mid ocean to much more. Double   
clicking is an alternative to display the object query dialog. Here is  
 an example from a lateral buoy in the entrance channel to a medium 
sized   port.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/objq.png" alt="" height="489" width="441"><br>

quickly zoom in and out.</p>
For zooming in smaller steps try
<ul>

<img src="images/vecoverz.png" alt="" height="455" width="600"><br>
<br>
If you zoom in enough there will appear a warning "OverZoom" in the 
upper left part of the chart area. This means that you have zoomed in 
way to far, and is using the chart<br>
at a scale that was never intended, and that is not supported by the 
original survey. No new information will be seen, and the situation is 
potentially dangerous<br>
as it could give the impression of  increased distance between dangers.<br>
On a raster-chart pixelation  will be seen, but on a vector chart it is not so<br>
obvious when you have over zoomed. This is where the warning is useful.<br>
Your first action when the warning appears should be to zoom out at least one snap.<br>
Charts are generally based on surveys in twice the scale of the released
 chart, so when zooming in beyond a factor of 2, there is no support, 
increased details etc, in the underlying survey.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nigel Calder "How to read a Nautical Chart, Second ed. 2012"</strong>,
 is recommended to all users who want to know more about charts, the 
surveys they are based on, and their horizontal and vertical  accuracy.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN allows quite a bit of over-zooming by default, but it is also 
possible to change this by editing a line in the opecpn.ini (config) 
file. Find this line:<br>
AllowExtremeOverzoom=1<br>
and change it to <br>
AllowExtremeOverzoom=0<br>
This will still allow over-zooming up to a factor of about 2.5 for 
larger scale raster charts and about a factor 4 for similar vector 
charts. A stricter recommendation based on how charts are compiled, and 
their de facto accuracy, would limit this to a factor 2.<br>

  <h1 id="StatusBar" class="book-heading">Status Bar</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>At the bottom of the display, is the Status Bar(s). Activated from 'Tool Box-Show Status Bar'.</p>

<p>Just above the Status Bar is the 'Chart Selection Bar'. CTRL +B toggles this bar on/off.<br>
It shows all the available chart for the present view represented by one
 segment for each chart. The order between the segments represents the 
scale of the charts. Largest scale to the left, smallest to the right. 
If CM93 is available, it is always furthest to the right.<br>
The segmented color bars in the Status Bar represent:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Blue for Raster</li>
	<li>Green For ENC's</li>
	<li>Brown/Yellow for CM93 charts</li>
	<li>The current chart displays as a lighter shade of its color, or if 
quilting is active, the charts currently making up the quilt are 
displayed in lighter shade.</li>
	<li>The Chart bar below consisting of 12 segments shows a quilt of two 
active charts. Five charts in the quilt are hidden, due to small scale. 
CM93 is in it's place, to the right. Four charts of larger scale than 
the present view are available. The largest scale chart is a Transverse 
Mercator chart.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/seg.png" alt="" height="97" width="700"></p>

<h3 id="Limitation">Limitation</h3>
The Chart Bar handles a maximum of 100 charts. The largest scale charts 
will be dropped first if more than 100 chart are available on a 
position. It is unlikely that this will be much of a limitation, but the
 possibility certainly exists if a lot of info charts, pilot charts and 
weather charts etc, are loaded. The symptom will be that large scale 
charts becomes impossible to display.

<p><br>
When you hover the mouse pointer over the bar, and not in quilting mode, a thumbnail of the chart will appear under the <a href="#ScalingCharts"><em>Scaling Charts</em> </a>icons
 and a chart information box will pop up just above the button. If 
quilting is on, instead of a thumbnail, the chart represented by the 
button will be highlighted in a transparent reddish color. By clicking 
on the appropriate bar, or using the appropriate <a href="#HotKeysandShortcuts"><em>Hot Keys and Shortcuts</em></a>,
 you will switch to the chart shown in the thumbnail. This feature is 
especially useful if you wish to view an ENC or a Raster chart of the 
same area.</p>

Scale of the display and the Zoom Factor. If the Zoom Factor is missing,
 the chart quilting feature is activated. The Zoom factor is the Scale 
(as above) divided with the natural scale of the chart.<br>

    The raster chart represented by this button don't participate in the

<br>
To illustrate a lot of this, here is a screen shot in quilting mode.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Quilt1.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
<em>The screen is a quilt of two Polyconical charts. Hovering the mouse 
pointer over the left chart-button highlights the lager scale chart for 
Manitowoc. Two smaller scale charts that cover the area displayed on the
 screen are included in the quilt, but are invisible as they are covered
 by the larger scale charts. To view these charts, right-click anywhere 
on a chart in the quilt and select "Remove this chart from quilt", one 
of these charts will now be shown in the quilt.<br>
The Brown right most button shows that CM93 version 2, charts are available for the area, but not currently displayed.<br>
The information box shows relevant information about the chart. We can 
see that the chart is  Polyconic, and because of this a warning is 
displayed for poor accuracy. The reason is, that although Polyconic 
charts are allowed to participate in quilting, the result is not totally
 free from errors, however small.</em><br>

  <h1 id="ChartQuilting" class="book-heading">Chart Quilting</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->Chart quilting is a way to display parts of several charts together on the screen, redrawn to the same scale.<br>
<br>
<strong>Limitation</strong><br>
Mercator charts, Transverse Mercator charts and Polyconic chart are 
quilted separately and don't mix. The transition from one form of 
quilting to the other is seamless. The background world chart can appear
 in Tmerc and Polyconic quilt in areas where there is no other chart 
coverage.<br>
By quilting, any information available in the white border around a chart, will be hidden.<br>
To see this information hit "F9" to temporarily get into single mode display. <br>
Skewed charts don't quilt, unless the skew is less than 5°. <br>
<br>
<strong>Quick Start</strong><br>
Go to Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Enable Chart Quilting. Tick he box. 
Once quilting is on in the Toolbox, F9 becomes a toggle switch to 
temporarily get into single mode display. Zooming in, automatically 
brings up larger scale charts, if available. Panning reveals a 
continuous quilt of the available charts. If you started with a raster 
chart, only raster-charts, and perhaps CM93, will be in the quilt. The 
same logic applies to S57 Vector Charts (ENCS). Make sure you are 
familiar with the <a href="#StatusBar"><em>Status Bar</em></a> as 
this will help you interpret all available information. The quilt, like a
 single chart can be displayed North Up or Course Up read more:  <a href="#AutoFollowandDisplayOrientation"><em>Auto Follow and Display Orientation</em></a>.<br>

<h3 id=""> </h3>
<p><em>The situation changes dramatically when quilting mode is 
activated. The amount of  relevant information on the screen increases, 
and the next chart is automalically available.<br>
</em></p>
<h3 id="Displayingcharts"><br>
Displaying charts</h3>
OpenCPN has two modes of displaying charts, single chart mode and quilting mode.<br>
<br>
<strong>Single Chart Mode</strong> only shows one chart at a time, and a
 switch to other charts  must be done by clicking another chart in the 
Chart Bar. All printed general chart information, outside the chart 
proper, can easily be read.<br>
<br>
<strong>To activate</strong> <strong>chart quilting </strong>go to 
Options -&gt; Display  and tick the box "Enable Chart Quilting",  tick 
the box "Show Chart Outlines" at the same time as this will help you see
 which chart mode is active. For CM93 the outline of individual charts 
can bee seen only if quilting is disabled.<br>
<br>
<strong>Full Screen Quilting</strong>. Options -&gt; Display -&gt; "Disable Fullscreen Quilting". <font color="#000000"><span>By
 default all visible charts of an appropriate scale are used in the 
quilt. With this box checked only charts that overlap the center of the 
screen are used in the quilt. Checking this box is easier on the system 
and may give a performance boost in certain circumstances.</span></font><br>
<br>
<strong>Is Chart quilting on?</strong><br>
There are some visual indications on screen to confirm if quilting is on or off.
<ul>
    <li>The colored rectangles in the status bar have rounded corners 
and the white borders of the charts are invisible when quilting is on. 
When quilting is off in ToolBox-&gt;Settings, the colored rectangles 
have "square" corners.</li>
    <li>If you have the status bar visible at he bottom of the screen, a
 value in brackets after the scale, to the far right, is only shown in 
single mode. The value within the brackets is the zoom factor.</li>
    <li>When hovering with the mouse pointer over a inactive raster 
chart button in single chart mode, a thumbnail of the chart is displayed
 in the upper left corner of the screen. At the same time an information
 box pops up above the button with details about the chart.  This 
changes with quilting, as the thumbnails are replaced with a transparent
 reddish high-lighting of the charts that is a part of the present quilt
 or has a larger scale than the reference chart in the quilt. This means
 that if Mercator charts are quilted the Transverse Mercator Charts will
 not be highlighted, and vice versa.</li>
    <li>The exception to the last rule is CM93 charts. When an area is 
only covered by CM93 charts, indicated by a long yellow chart button in 
the status bar, and in quilting mode, no info-box is displayed and no 
reddish highlighting is taking place.</li>
    <li>When CM93 quilting is off, the outline of the individual cells are outlined in magenta.</li>
</ul>
<br>
More than one chart can be displayed and active at the same time, on the
 picture above, for example there are two pale blue buttons, as there 
are two raster-charts in this quilt. In single mode only one chart 
button is highlighted at a time.<br>
<br>
Depth units that is normally shown in the upper right corner of the 
display, if activated in the toolbox, is only displayed in quilting mode
 if all participating charts  uses the same unit.<br>
Zoom level, normally displayed on the far right on the Status bar, is not present in quilting.<br>
<br>
Many of these features are illustrated in this screen-dump.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Quilt4.png" alt="" height="530" width="700"><br>
<em><br>
This is a quilt consisting of three raster charts, two that are actually
 displayed and one smaller scale chart that is hidden behind the larger 
scaled charts of St Croix.<br>
<img src="images/hidden-quilt.png" alt="" height="21" width="150">  This is the button for the not displayed chart in the quilt.<br>
The mouse pointer is over the middle raster chart and the chart 
information box is shown, together with the red highlighting of the 
chart on the screen.<br>
If the chart info box contains much less info than above, just click the
 button to display the chart, then go back and hover with the cursor 
over the chart button again. The full info will now be available.<br>
No depth unit is shown in the quilt as the left chart is in Feet and the
 right in Fathoms and parts thereof. Notice the lack of zoom level in 
the status bar, a quilt , by definition, consists of several different 
zoom levels.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Which charts are quilted?</strong><br>
There are several rules built into OpenCPN governing exactly how different charts reacts to the quilting mode.<br>
<strong>Raster charts</strong> and <strong>Vector charts </strong>are 
quilted separately and don't mix together. You can quilt either raster 
charts or vector charts, but not both at the same time. <br>
<br>
The exception to this rule is that CM93 ver2 charts, if available, are 
shown if no other Mercator chart cover exists for a displayed area, for 
both raster- and vector- chart quilting. <br>
<br>
CM93 chart also kicks in (if available), if the view is so far zoomed out<br>
that the rightmost (smallest scale) raster chart is  too small to be 
useful. OpenCPN remembers that this selection of CM93 is due to 
attempted  under-zoom of a raster chart. Then, when you zoom in again, 
it tries to return to the raster chart  that caused the auto-shift to 
cm93.  If that chart is not available, it  makes best effort to find a 
useful small scale raster chart. <br>
<br>
Transverse Mercator Charts, which are all raster charts, are strictly 
quilted on their own. In this case, the background map is visible where 
there is no coverage.<br>
Polyconic Charts, which are all raster charts as well, are also strictly
 quilted on their own. The background world map is visible where ther is
 no other chart coverage.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 ver2</strong> charts can be quilted separately.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mercator Charts</strong> are always quilted in quilting mode but don't quilt together with Transverse Mercator charts or Polyconic charts.<br>
<strong>Polyconic Charts</strong>, are quilted separately, and don't mix with Mercator or Transverse Mercator Charts<br>
<strong>Skewed Charts</strong> are allowed in the quilt as long as they don't deviate more than 5 degrees<br>
from North Up.<br>
<strong>Transverse Mercator Charts  </strong>are quilted separately from Mercator- and Polyconic- Charts.<br>
"<strong>BSB4</strong>" and "<strong>nv-charts</strong>", using plugins, quilts with other Raster Charts, following the rules above.<br>
<br>
<strong>User control</strong>.<br>
Users can control if an individual chart, is allowed in the quilt or 
not. Right clicking on any chart in a quilt and clicking "Remove this 
chart from quilt" on the pop up menu, removes the chart from the quilt. 
The chart button in the Status bar changes to <img src="images/not_participate.png" alt="" height="20" width="60">.<br>
To activate the chart again right click this button an then click "Ad this chart to quilt"<br>
<br>
<strong>Controlling the scale of the quilt view</strong>.<br>
<img src="images/quilt-ref.png" alt="" height="27" width="600"><br>
The "quilt reference chart" is the left-most, largest scale chart, 
highlighted in the chart bar. This is the left of the two pale blue 
chart buttons above.<br>
Click the next chart blue button "one-to-the-right" of the of the 
current reference chart. The reference scale of the quilt will be 
decreased, but the viewpoint will not change. The same logic applies if 
clicking a chart-to-the-left of the present reference chart, except that
 the scale of the quilt will increase. Zooming in/out will also move the
 reference chart to the left/right.<br>
<br>
<strong>Known issue with some NOAA ENC:s </strong><br>
<br>
<img src="images/stXhole1.png" alt="" height="547" width="600"><br>
<br>
Some NOAA ENC:s are produced with "holes" in. OpenCPNs handles almost 
all of these cases.  The picture above is from S:t Croix in the 
Caribbean. <br>
<br>
The gray rectangle above is a "hole" in a chart, where a smaller scale 
chart with coverage exists. The "hole" is due to the fact that this area
 wasn't surveyed to the scale of the chart.<br>

  <h1 id="ChartGroups" class="book-heading">Chart Groups</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
Chart Groups solves the following problem:  You may have many charts  
loaded in your active database. Some of them have overlapping coverage  
at the same scale, so that when quilted the logic does not know which of
  potentially several  <br>
Another example:  Pilot charts as one Group, normal navigation charts as
 another Group, makes it possible to quickly switch between them.<br>
<br>
Final example:  in another universe, NGA charts in one group, standard NOAA RNCs in another, British UKHO in a third group.<br>
<br>
The Chart Group function allows us to define multiple Groups, with  
different chart directories in each group. The Group desired for viewing
  may be selected quickly without adding or deleting charts from the  
Active database.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Chartbar322.png" alt="" height="539" width="600"><br>
<br>
In Options -&gt;Charts, select "Chart Groups"<br>
You will see two panes.  The top pane contains you installed ("Active") 
 chart directories. The bottom pane allows you to create, edit, and  
delete Groups. Note that there is always an "All Charts" group.  This 
Group is not editable. New Groups which you  create may have chart 
directories or individual charts added to them by  selecting the item in
 the top pane and touching the "Add"  button.<br>
You may also remove individual charts or directories from Groups by 
selecting the desired item in the bottom pane, and  touch  "Remove 
Chart". Please note that "removing" an item from the  Group does not 
remove it from your "Available" set of charts.  The item is simply made 
unavailable when the Group is in use.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="UsingyourGroups">Using your Groups</h2>
<br>
<img src="images/ChartGroups321.png" alt="" height="387" width="600"><br>
<br>
<em>In this illustration the navigator generally uses the US charts, 
when available. Coming into Baia do Porto Santo a detailed chart would 
be great, but no such US chart is available on board. A switch to the UK
 chart group solves the problem.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ChartGroups322.png" alt="" height="412" width="600"><br>
<br>
<br>
Select the Group you want to use, by a right-click context menu item 
called "Chart Groups". As you switch Groups the logic tries to select a 
chart and scale that closely matches the situation present before the 
switch.  As you may understand, sometimes the fit is not reasonable, so 
the resulting view may be surprising.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you have no Groups defined, as in the default installation, all installed charts are always available.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chart Groups and CM93</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="images/cm93grp.png" alt="" height="165" width="600"><br>
<br>
It is possible to have multiple instances of CM93v2 in different Chart 
Groups. Above we have 5 instances loaded in various chart groups. The 
view is of "All Active Charts".<br>
OpenCP also supports multiple partial CM93 datasets. <br>
The instances are loaded, from left to right, in the order of the chart groups.<br>
In this situation, only the leftmost instance of CM93, that is not 
excluded from the quilt, will be displayed. Above, it is the instance 
represented by the yellow rectangle.<br>

<strong>First</strong>, one very important setting for vector charts is handled directly from the main toolbar.<br>
<img src="images/text.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> This button toggles all text displayed on a vector chart On and Off.<br>
The hotKey "T" is an alternative for toggling the text.<br>
In OpenGL mode, all text will always be horizontal when using  the "Curse Up" option.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Second</strong>, double clicking on a vector chart, as long as 
the cursor has'nt changed to a green arrow near the edges, brings up an 
information dialog, displaying  the available vector-chart information 
at the selected point. Scroll down to see all the information. An 
alternative to double clicking is right-clicking an select "Object 
Query".<br>
Note that a single normal (left) click will center the chart at on that point.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/dyngnaset.png" alt="" height="556" width="451"><br>
 <br>
The example is taken from double-clicking on a lighthouse in a busy area.<br>
Exactly what is shown in this dialog depend on the settings described below in "Display Categories".<br>
<br>
<strong>Third, </strong>it is  possible to select what font is used for 
the text on vector charts. There is an entry  in 
theToolBox-&gt;Languages/Fonts-&gt;Choose Fonts tab, called <strong>ChartTexts</strong>.
 Here you select what font-face to use, and a template size. Weight and 
final size of the displayed texts depends on the charts you are using, 
but if the charts contain various weights and sizes, they will all scale
 together depending on what size you select.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
<strong>The Options-Charts-Vector Charts Tab is where everything else is handled.</strong></p>
<img src="images/vectorSettings.png" alt="" height="666" width="600"><br>
 
<h3 id="DisplayCategories">Display Categories</h3>
<br>
Navigators has the choice  of three pre-defined, different, 
presentations of ENC content, Base, Standard and Other. OpenCPN also has
 the very flexible Mariners Standard, which is better described as 
"Mariners Choice".<br>
 
<h4 id="Base">Base</h4>
Displays general  information, including coastline, safety-contour, isolated danger,<br>
buoy, beacon traffic separation zone, etc.<br>
<br>
From the IMO definitions:<br>
Display Base means the level of SENC information which cannot be removed from<br>
the display, consisting of information which is required at all times in
 all geographic areas and all circumstances. It is not intended to be 
sufficient for safe navigation.
<h4 id="Standard"><br>
Standard</h4>
Everything in "Base" and aids to navigation, fairways, channel limits, restricted navigation zones, restricted areas, etc..

<h4 id="Other"><br>
Other</h4>
Everything in "Standard" and more. This level could be described as "all essentials". More about what the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ecdis">IMO ECDIS</a>
 says about the content of these three levels. This is a good choice for
 actual, underway, navigation, avoiding the possible risks involved in 
"Mariners Standard". See more below.<br>
 
<h4 id="MarinersStandard">Mariners Standard</h4>
Users can use  the filter tick box to set exactly what he or she wants 
displayed. A large set of filters, about 186, can be employed. They are 
all to the IHO S57 standard, but has been given a label that is easy to 
understand.<br>
Note that Mariners Standard gives the user a much wider choice of what 
to display, than approved ECDIS system are allowed. It is for example 
possible to not display items in the Base category.<br>
<br>
These Hot Keys all works in "Mariners standard". Features are toggled on/off with the keys.

<p id="GUID-6BCAAD17-7700-4BAD-95FA-552F311BA0FE">A general 
recommendation would be to use "Mariners Standard" and to "Select All", 
to start with, and then switch of certain features as required.</p>
As an example let's look at passing through the British gas fields in the SW North Sea<br>
<br>
<img src="images/europe1.png" alt="" height="415" width="480"><br>
<br>
This is not easy, so we want to get rid of all those red and yellow circles.<br>
Right click on one of the platforms, square with a dot.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/platquery.png" alt="" height="416" width="364"><br>
<br>
Click "Object Query", and then one of the "Light" lines in the left column.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/nsplattform.png" alt="" height="488" width="577"><br>
<br>
At the top of the right column i says "Feature Class: LIGHTS".<br>
Find "Light" in the Mariners Standard list of available filters, and untick it.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/vector-light.png" alt="" height="338" width="234"><br>
<br>
Press the "Apply" button!<br>
<br>
<img src="images/europe3.png" alt="" height="389" width="480"><br>
<br>
Much better!<br>
In this particular case, there is a shortcut. Use the Hot Key "L" to toggle all lights on/off.<br>
 
<h4 id="DepthSoundings">Depth Soundings</h4>
turns the measured depths on and of. Other settings also affects when 
soundings are displayed, for example "Reduced Detail at Small Scale". 
The dark black numbers are not soundings. Instead they refer to heights 
of nearby islets or cays. On official paper charts the soundings are 
printed in italics.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/sounding.png" alt="" height="299" width="374"><br>
<br>
The bold number 20 refers to the land height of the unnamed cay SW of the number.<br>
"Safety Depth" is set to 20 m, so the 20 m contour stands out in black.<br>
<br>
 
<h4 id="ChartInformationObjects">Chart Information Objects</h4>
earlier called "Meta Objects", relates to information about the chart 
itself. With this switch on, an object query reveals such information as
 the buoyage system for the area, the quality of the survey, the latest 
NTM update and sources for the chart.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/meta.png" alt="" height="400" width="400"><br>
 
<h4 id="ImportantTextOnly">Important Text Only</h4>
displays only a bare minimum of text essential for navigation, such as 
course and bearing in a leading line (range) and bridge clearances.<br>
 
<h4 id="ReducedDetailatSmallScale">Reduced Detail at Small Scale</h4>
makes sure that a minimum scale is required  before certain objects are shown. If this box is <strong>not </strong>ticked<strong>, </strong>everything is always shown, leading to very cluttered view at small scale (zoomed out).<br>
 
<h4 id="Bouy/Light Labels">Bouy/Light Labels</h4>
displays names and purposes of aids to navigation, such as number or name of buoys, information about conspicuous objects etc

<h4 id="LightDescriptions"><br>
Light Descriptions</h4>
this tick box control display of light characteristics. Checking this 
displays  a label with a text describing the marker or lighthouse's 
characteristics.

<h4 id="ExtendedLightSectors"><br>
Extended Light Sectors</h4>

<p>It is often difficult on a vector chart  to see exactly what the light-sectors are supposed to do.</p>

<h4 id=""><br>
<img src="images/havannah-noext.png" alt="" height="249" width="500"></h4>

<p>Activating the Extended Light sectors clarifies the situation. All 
sectors are extended and leading white sectors are emphasized in yellow 
and extend the full nominal range of the light-house. Just hold the 
cursor over a ligt and the extended sectors are activated.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/havannah-ext.png" alt="" height="254" width="500"></p>

<h4 id="De-Cluttered Text">De-Cluttered Text</h4>
Even when using "Reduced Detail at Small Scale", there are cases when 
text labels overlaps or overwrites other labels and creates a cluttered 
impression. Ticking this box clears up this mess. To see all the labels,
 increase the scale for the area. For Lights with many sectors, the text
 label for each sector overwrite each-other. With this box ticked only 
the first sector label is displayed. For full information regarding 
sector lights, do an object query.

<h3 id="Chartdisplaystyle"><br>
Chart display style</h3>
 

<h4 id="Points">Points</h4>
Paper chart draw the markers and lights just like the printed paper 
chart, while simplified uses icons to represent the same. Some like the 
one and some the other, a matter of taste.<br>
Paper Chart mode closely follows the IHO standard standard in this area.
 This mode is currently more developed than the simplified mode, as it 
has a higher priority in the development effort.<br>
 
<h4 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h4>
Plain normally just uses a dashed line, while the Symbolized version also uses triangles pointing into the area.<br>
<br>
 
<h4 id="Colors">Colors</h4>
Depth on the chart can be displayed with either 2 or 4 colors. This 
setting is closely related to the "Depths Settings". With 2 colors, and 
using a relatively large scale, areas with depth less than "Safety 
Depth" is blue, the rest is white. With 4 colors, there are different 
colors for areas less than "Shallow Depth", areas between "Shallow 
Depth" and "Safety Depth", areas between "Safety Depth" and "Deep Depth"
 and finally for areas deeper than "Deep Depth".<br>
 
<h3 id=""> </h3>

<h4 id="CM93 Zoom Detail">CM93 Zoom Detail</h4>
Normal settings depend on a combination of personal preferences and 
present usage of map. To see more detail the "Zoom detail" can be set to
 a higher positive number or for navigation in shipping lanes to a 
negative numbers. Typical zoom level 5 is good for fishing when as much 
details are possible is of interest. Zoom level of +1, zero or -1 is 
usually fine for normal use.<br>
Positive values give more detail, but at a cost:<br>
a. It simply takes longer to render larger scale charts covering more screen real estate.<br>
b. There will be more instances of gray (NODATA) areas surrounding the 
larger scale charts as you zoom out, unless quilting is activated.<br>
c. It can become dramatically slower if high detail is specified, and 
chart outlines are requested. In this case, the program has to read a 
lot more cells to get their outlines.<br>
<br>
Conversely, negative values give less detail. Zooms are faster.<br>
<br>
The slider can also be activated through the right click meny, and displayed directly on the screen.
<h3 id="DepthSettings"><br>
Depth Settings</h3>
These settings are very important as they affect how the different depths are colored.<br>
They can help you identify a deep channel for example, or they can, in  
the worst case secenario, prevent you from beeing aware of a shallow 
area.<br>
There is no setting that fits all circumstances. For example a Seamount 
with a depth of 20m  in the middle of an ocean should be regarded as 
"shallow" and be avoided, while 20 m depth in a harbor approach in 
protected water, probably is safe.<br>
<br>
The Depth Settings controls the coloring of the water as a function of 
depth. By setting the Safety and Deep water right you will have a 
visible border to show when to take care about shallow water. <br>
CM93 charts and S57 ENCS works very similar in this area.The charts 
contains depth area features according to fixed depth cutoff zones, 
usually 5, 10, and 20 meters. Intermediate values are not available in 
the database,if you select a value between those available, opencpn 
chooses the next higher value available for display of color.<br>
The charts are inconsistent in this area, depending on the country 
issuing the original  charts. For example in UK and the Netherlands the 
depth contours in CM93 are 2, 5 and 10 meter while in Sweden they are 3,
 6 and 10 meter!<br>
Generally for both S57 ENC and CM93, find these fixed depth cutoffs by 
right clicking -&gt; Object Query -&gt;Chart -&gt; Depth Area. The two 
values DRVAL1 and DRVAL2 represents these built in cutoffs.<br>
If for example, as is the case on the South China Sea Hydrographic 
Commissions charts, the shallowest area has a   DRVAL1 = 0 m and a 
DRVAL2 = 10 m, there is, in most cases, no point in setting "Shallow 
Depth" to anything but 10 m.<br>
Find out these cut off depth for your area and set the "Depth Settings" 
with this knowledge together with your preferences and activity.<br>
<br>
Note that Shallow,Safety and Deep Depths are always in meters, even if soundings are chosen to be displayed in another unit.<br>
<br>
With all the reservations above, the general case for 4 colors, will be described.
<h4 id="ShallowDepth"><br>
<br>
Shallow Depth</h4>
will color all water areas with water depths shallower than the set depth to a dark blue color.Soundings are in black.

<h4 id="SafetyDepth"><br>
Safety Depth</h4>
water deeper that Shallow but shallower that this depth will have a 
paler blue color. The  Shallow Depth contour clearly marked with dark 
gray borderline.Soundings less than this depth are in black, while 
soundings greater than this value are gray.

<h4 id="DeepDepth"><br>
Deep Depth</h4>
water deeper than Safety Depth but less than Deep Depth will display a 
light gray color. The  Safety Depth contour  is clearly marked with 
black borderline. Water deeper than Deep Depth is displayed in white.<br>
<br>
<strong>Finally</strong> a word about <strong>drying heights</strong>, 
displayed in green. There is no detailed information available for the 
value of the drying heights, neither in CM93 ver2 nor in many S57 
charts, currently available for OpenCPN. Some S57 charts have negative 
DRVAL1  and  DRVAL2 = 0 m in areas with drying heights. This adds very 
little, as it really only gives the information that the drying height 
is less than DRVAL1 in an area of unspecified size. Raster charts seems 
to be the only alternative for navigation in shallow areas with a large 
tide.<br>
<br>
Hopefuly this will change.<br>
A set of new charts released in april 2012, by the Dutch Authorites, sets a standard for others to follow in this regard.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/dh.png" alt="" height="324" width="406"><br>
<br>
Compared to CM93.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/bramb1.png" alt="" height="335" width="600"><br>
<br>
When is safe to pass across Bramble Bank? The CM93 vectorchart gives us 
no information whatsoever, neither on the chart, nor in the Object Query
 dialog.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/bramb.png" alt="" height="325" width="600"><br>
<br>
While a raster chart tells us that we need a Hight of Tide that is 1.2m + safety margin + the draft of our own vessel.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/bramb2.png" alt="" height="425" width="600"><br>
<br>
Heights of islands etc. are not available in CM93, while S57 charts have
 info about heights of summits and peaks but no contour lines.<br>
Is Balls Pyramid a high Island, that the name implies, or is it named 
with the same sarcastic humor as "Greenland" ? CM93 can't tell.<br>

<p><strong>BSB Versions 1, 2 and 3, with chart files ending with ".kap".</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>BSB Version 4 </strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".cap"</strong>, works with a non free plugin, for Windows only.See the <a href="http://opencpn.org/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a> download page.<br>
<br>
<strong>NOS/GEO Version 1</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".nos" and ".geo".</strong> (Subsequent versions are probably supported but need to be tested. However, this format is obsolete for new charts.)<br>
<br>
<span><strong>"nv-charts"</strong></span>, <strong>with chart files ending with ".eap"</strong>, are supported through  a non free plugin, for Windows only. See the <a href="http://opencpn.org/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a> download page.</p>

<p><strong>CM93 Version 2.</strong><br>
(C-map Version 3, and later, is in a preprocessed proprietary SENC format  and is not supported.)</p>

<p><strong>S57/S52 (ENC)</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".000". </strong><br>
OpenCPNs internal<strong> </strong>SENC files has a ".S57" file extension.<br>
<br>
If a chart is said to be a S57 Vector chart, and has a different file 
ending, it is likely to be a SENC file, a processed version of a ".000" 
chart file, in a proprietary, platform specific format, that OpenCPN 
can't handle.<br>

<p>Generally chart pictures in <strong>gif, jpeg, pdf, png, tif, bmp </strong>and other formats can be used, when properly geo-referenced, to generate<strong> kap </strong>files. For the details about this process read the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/chart_conversion_manual"><em>Chart Conversion Manual</em></a>.  Also, make sure to browse around the forum as there are a handful of  interesting chart related threads.<br>

<p><strong>WCI</strong> charts generated with <a href="http://www.sping.com/seaclear/">SeaClear and MapCal </a>can
 also be transformed to BSB charts and used by OpenCPN. The key is to 
open a WCI chart in MapCal and then "Tools-&gt;Convert-&gt;Current WCI 
to BMP" to convert the chart to a BMP picture. More about using MapCal, a
 part of SeaClear, for chart conversions, is available here: <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/chart_conversion_linux"><em>Conversion Using Linux</em></a>. MapCal works just fine with Linux, using Wine.<br>

<b>OziExplorer</b><b><i> </i></b>charts consisting of picture in one of the standard formats, together with a georeferencing "<strong>.map</strong>" file, can be converted to a bsb kapfile. A Ruby script for this conversion is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/map2kap_0.1.11.rb_.zip"><strong>here</strong></a> and a more developed windows version<a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/map2kap-oziexplorer-to-opencpn-47828-10.html#post929755"><strong> here.</strong></a>
  Ozi charts of the ozfx2 or ozfx3 format can not be converted with this
 tool. These Ozi formats are not documented and proprietary, and cannot 
be displayed in OpenCPN.</p>

<p> The <strong>HDR/PCX </strong>charts, used prior to the BSB format, 
was used from the late eighties to mid nineties. While these charts 
cannot be used directly in OpenCPN, the chartpicture as such, can be 
extracted. These charts consists of many picture tiles in <strong>pcx </strong>format,
 more than 100 tiles is not unusual. The tiles can be merged to one big 
picture, and then used as any other picture, to make an OpenCPN 
compatible chart. For details on this process see the<a href="http://opencpn.org/chart_conversion_linux"> <em>Chart Conversion Manual</em></a>  and <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/open-chart-standard-32731-4.html#post381315">this post</a> and the following posts in the forum. A script for merging the pcx tiles to one picture is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/pcx2tif.zip">here.</a></p>

<p> The HDR format is from an era when computer-memory and processing 
power were less powerful than today, as a consequence these charts are 
not of the same quality as more modern charts. Furthermore, most of 
these charts are not using WGS84 as reference datum. These charts should
 not be the first choice, but can be useful if nothing else is 
available.</p>

<h3 id="Other formats that are not supported.">Other formats that are <em>not</em> supported.</h3>
<strong>S63 Encrypted ENC charts </strong>are not supported. This is the
 format for the majority of newly produced vector charts from many 
national hydrographic offices. S63 charts are exactly the same as S57 
except the they are encrypted to keep them from being illegally 
distributed.

<p>The Hydrographic Chart Raster Format, <strong>HCRF</strong>, used by 
the United Kingdom Hydrographic Offices' ARCS (Admiralty Raster Chart 
Service), Australian Hydrographic Services' Seafarer products and the NZ<em>Mariner</em>, New Zealands Official charts, are not supported.  This is also due to proprietary encryption algorithms and copyright issues.<br>
<br>
Charts from<strong> Mapmedia</strong>, <strong>Navionic</strong>, <strong>C-map</strong>(with
 the exception of CM93 version 2) and various other formats are not 
supported, for the same reasons as for the other proprietary charts.<br>

The motivation for releasing these charts is well worth reading.
	<p><cite>Realizing that official and high quality small scale ENCs 
conforming with the established IHO standard were not available for the 
SCS, the EAHC MSs decided to cooperate closely and resolve the situation
 so that mariners could use most up-to-date chart information for voyage
 planning and enhancing safety of navigation, rather than resorted to 
some commercially developed electronic products which were either 
prepared in proprietary formats, or containing unofficial data with very
 infrequent updating... It was the view that if the SCS ENC could be 
freely and widely available to mariners, it would further enhance the 
safety of navigation in the region. This in turn could reduce the 
chances of environmental damage from grounding and oil pollution, which 
have tremendous cost impact. The EAHC decided to provide the SCS ENC to 
users free of charge.</cite></p>

    <li>The default own ship icon can be replaced by  putting a file 
"ownship.png" in the User icons shared data directory. More about this  
shared directory here: <a href="#MarksandRoutes"><em>Marks and Routes</em></a></li>
    <li>The Auto Follow button useful for two different situations:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>When you have panned the map away from your current location and want to quickly move back to your vessel.</li>
    <li>When underway, this will keep the display on the chart around your vessel, with the boat at the center of the chart.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Panning the chart will disable Auto Follow mode. Simply click <img src="images/auto-follow_0.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> again to turn <strong>Auto Follow</strong>
 mode back on. Zooming in/out with the scrollwheel is OK as no panning 
takes place unless Options-&gt;Display-&gt;"Zoom-to Cursor" is ticked.</li>
    <li>The display can be oriented three different ways, normally it is <strong>North Up</strong> but  <strong>Course Up</strong>
 is an alternative. With Course Up OpenCPN uses COG, course over ground.
 The easiest way to change between these two modes is through the "Right
 Click" menu. One situation where course up might be considered is when 
navigating a river or a canal. The third orientation is when skew charts
 are displayed, they are simply shown as "<strong>Chart Up</strong>",  but an optional setting exist to show them as "North Up".</li>
    <li>In the picture below the Course Up is active. COG is 41Deg. 
Notice how all text on the vector chart, is aligned correctly. This only
 works in OpenGL mode. The red arrow, in the upper right corner, is 
always pointing North.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/course-up.png" alt="" height="605" width="800"><br>
<ul>
    <li><span>If the option "Show skewed raster charts as North-up" in the Options-&gt;Display  tab,  is <strong>not</strong>
 ticked, the right-click toggle option "Course  Up  Mode/North Up Mode" 
will be replaced by "Course Up Mode /Chart Up Mode", for skewed charts.</span></li>
    <li>If an electronic compass is available in the NMEA stream the own
 ship icon will be orientated according to this heading. The difference 
can be seen on the chart if there is a cross current, for example.  The 
boat below is heading WNW but is being set SW. An AIS CPA, Closest Point
 of Approach is also visible.    </li>
</ul>
<img src="images/dashn3.png" alt="" align="textTop" height="187" width="200"><br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><img src="images/north-up.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="34" width="29">  This icon (blue color) to the far right in the ToolBar indicates that the display is in <strong>North Up </strong>mode.</li>
    <li><img src="images/course-up_0.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="28" width="28"> The red version of the icon indicates <strong>Course Up </strong>
 mode. These settings are toggled in the rightclick menu, but can also 
be controlled in the Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Course Up Mode. Just 
below this option, the update period for course up, can be set. This 
comes in handy, for example, to perevent the display jerking around in a
 chop.</li>
    <li>Note that both the red and the blue arrows are <strong>always</strong> pointing North.</li>
    <li><strong>Look Ahead!</strong> To see more of the chart in front 
of the boat, activate Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Look Ahead  Mode. Your
 own boat will no longer be in the center of the screen. Instead it will
 be located away from the center, in the opposite direction to your 
present gps course(COG).</li>
    <li><strong>Don't always Look Ahead!</strong> If you are at anchor, 
swinging on the hook produces random courses and low speeds.If Look 
Ahead is on in this situation  the chart rendering will constantly be 
redrawn, with the boat in all possible lookahead positions as the course
 changes. To prevent this kind of scenario OpenCPN works like this:<br>
    *If the boat speed is less than 1 kt, then lookahead is disabled.<br>
    *If boat speed is greater than 3 kts, lookahead is enabled.<br>
    *In between 1 and 3 kts, the lookahead "distance" is adjusted smoothly.<br>
    *If  the problems still there when doing more than 3 kts, consider 
using  "Options-&gt;Connections -&gt; FilterNMEA Course and Speed data" 
 to average out the "jumpiness".</li>

charts are normally showed "chart up", as intended by design. If ticking
 this box, these charts are shown North-Up. In both cases, activating

Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tide and Current predictions are not available for all areas.</li>
    <li>OpenCPN comes with a built in tidal data file, but can use any 
legacy IDX or binary tcd file. Multiple tidal files can be used at the 
same time. More about this further down this page.</li>
    <li>As with all predictions, the displayed values are calculated using mathematical models and actual tides and currents will vary</li>
</ul>

    <li>Click the toolbar button <img src="images/tide.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> to see <strong>tide </strong>stations.</li>
    <li>Select <img src="images/current.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> to see <strong>current </strong>stations.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Available tide stations will show on the chart as green graphs with a "T" logo:</li>
    <li>The "T" becomes a yellow and blue vertical bar when the scale is greater than 1:500.000</li>

 The tidal rise is 2.5m above the chart datum. The blue part is "water".

    <li>The Tidal Dialog gives the name of the station as well as the 
the name of the Data Source file. This is important when you have 
multiple sources covering the same area. Time and height for HW and LW 
is displayed in the upper right part.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The Yellow box, with the tidal rise and time, follows the cursor
 when hovering over the dialog. The time axis at the bottom displays the
 time, in this case he timezone is "Z +01:00", which is the same as one 
hour ahead (east) of UTC, that used to be called GMT.</li>

    <li>The default dataset for tides and currents is limited, mainly for copyright reasons.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.flaterco.com/">Xtide</a>, a well known free 
software tidal aplication (GPL license), maintains regularly updated 
.tcd files for US, UK and the Netherlands. These are presently the only 
areas with, up to date freely available, tidal data. The latest updates 
are available from the Xtide site, <a href="http://www.flaterco.com/"> http://www.flaterco.com</a>.</li>
    <li>A number of different datasets are available on the Internet, 
with vastly greater coverage. Some of these datasets are quite old, and 
they also contains glitches and errors, many of which have been 
corrected in the OpenCPN default dataset.</li>
    <li>In many areas there are no free alternatives, and OpenCPN makes 
it possible to switch between data sets and even using them at the same 
time. If two stations are located on exactly the same position, only one
 will be visible......</li>

are the basic points that is used for many things, such as creating 
routes, marking fishing spots, good anchorages or anything of interest.<br>
<br>
Once a mark is created a focused right-click dialog becomes available, when clickin on the mark.<br>
<img src="images/wpt_focus2.png" alt=""><br>
 
<h5 id="Creatingamark">Creating a mark</h5>
There are a few ways to directly create marks.

<ul>
	<li>Pressing "Enter" or "Space" creates a mark at the boats position.</li>
	<li>"Ctrl + M" creates a mark at the cursor position.</li>
	<li>Right-click and and press "Drop Mark" creates a mark, at the position of the cursor, when clicking.</li>
	<li>Marks are created at the start of each leg in a route, and one at 
the end of the route. More about routes a bit further down this page.</li>
</ul>
Marks created these ways will have a triangular icon, except for routes that uses a diamond, but no name.<br>
<br>
The default icon, when creating a mark, is settable by changing the the value <b>"DefaultWPIcon"</b> in the opencpn.ini(config) file. Use the name of any available icon in the properties dialog.<br>

<p>You can <strong>move </strong>the mark by left-click-dragging it around.</p>

<p>You can <strong>delete</strong> a mark by right-clicking its icon, and selecting "Delete".<br>
There is an built in <strong>undo/redo </strong>buffer for creating, 
deleting or moving marks or waypoints. If you have just created, deleted
 or moved a mark the right-click dialog will have relevant entries. The 
undo/redo, for moving or creating marks, follows a straight time-line 
and is not tied to an individual mark.<br>

<br>
Above is a right-click menu just after moving a mark a few times and 
undoing the last move, and one mark was deleted, and then the deletion 
was undone. CTRL + Z and  CTRL + Y works as hot-keys for undo/redo.<br>
<br>
All marks have properties that can be seen by right-clicking and 
pressing "Properties", or even simpler just double click the mark.<br>
<strong>Read all about the properties dialog in </strong><a href="#ExtendedMarks"><em><strong>Extended Marks</strong></em></a><br>
Marks can be manipulated through the Route Managers Waypoints tab as 
well. Deleting a mark that is part of a route, will also change the 
route.Marks that are a part of a "layer" cannot be changed at all. Marks
 can also be imported into OpenCPN in a number of ways.<br>

and tick the box. This feature is handy, to prevent accidentally moving a
 mark. Activate this feature when underway, deactivate it when planning.<br>

 in the toolbar, or through hitting Ctrl + Space-bar. The mark looks 
like the button and is dropped on own boats present gps position. This 
mark cannot be moved or deleted with the cursor or keyboard (by 
mistake), but can still be deleted from the Route/Waypoint manager 
dialog. More about <a href="#ManOverBoard"><em>Man Over Board</em></a> here.<br>

<h3 id="UseyourownIcons">Use your own Icons</h3>
OpenCPN comes with a handful of different icons that can be assigned to a
 mark. Right click or use the Route Manager and activate the properties 
dialog. The Mark Icon window in the dialog shows the available icons. <br>
<br>
A user can install his or her own icons to use with marks and "own ship".<br>
<br>
1. Create a directory called "UserIcons" in the same place that holds 
your opencpn.ini(config) file. Instructions to find the directory 
(folder) location here:<a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a><br>
<br>
2. Add .png image files to this directory. The legacy .xpm format works 
as well. The icons can be any size. The name of the file (without the 
extension) becomes the name of the new waypoint icon. These new icons 
will appear on the Waypoint Properties dialog, and can be assigned to 
any waypoint. They can also be assigned in GPX Import files.<br>
<br>
3. The <a href="http://opencpn.org/drupal/user_icons">User Icons</a> page contains links to a few sets of user contributed icons.<br>
<br>
<a name="#"></a>4.To replace the default own ship icon <img src="images/ship_red.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19">
 , just  put a file "ownship.png" or "ownship.xpm", containing the 
ownship picture you prefer, in the UserIcons directory, described above.<br>
More about "ownship" icons and setting "ownship" size in <a href="#SettingOptions"><em>Setting Options</em></a><em>.</em>

Routes</h3>

<p>Press the <img src="images/route_002.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 -button and start  the creation of a route. Hotkey "CTRL R" is an 
alternative way to start a route and "Esc" ends the route. The cursor 
changes to a  (<img src="images/pencil2.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="16" width="31">
 ) pencil. Left click along the desired route you want to make. This 
will leave sequential numbered waypoints as you click along, the numbers
 will not be visible, but are available in the Route Properties Dialog, 
accessible through the right click menu or the Route Manager. The 
running total distance of the whole route will be shown along the 
"pencil" together with the course and distance from the last marked 
waypoint. When creating routes, OpenCPN will ask if it should use a 
nearby mark, when a route point is added that is close to an already 
existing mark. If answering "yes", the existing mark is copied to the 
route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc1.png" alt="" height="244" width="500"><br>
<br>
For longer distances, specially on east.west courses on higher 
latitudes, the Create Rout  tool seamlessly switches to also offer a 
great circles alternative, instead of Mercator rhumb-line route legs.

<br>
<img src="images/Route-rollover.png" alt="" height="535" width="650"><br>
Holding the cursor over the route brings up a roll-over info. The name 
of the route, if it is set in the properties dialog, the total length of
 the route, the course and distance for the leg under the cursor and 
distance run so far along the route, to the first waypoint in the 
current leg.<br>
Looking at the four legged route above. The total distance is 8.8 NMi. 
The third leg is 1.89 NMi i true direction 160° and the accumulated 
distance in the first two legs is 4.76 NMi.<br>
<br>
If your desired route extends off the currently displayed chart, move 
the route cursor in the desired direction and the display will 
automatically pan to show the area.  You can zoom in and out with the 
mouse scroll wheel or keyboard +/- keys during route creating.  You can 
also right click and select 'MAX DETAIL HERE' or 'Scale Out' during 
route creation. When finished right click and choose end route from the 
context menu, alternatively just press the "Esc" key.<br>
You should now have an inactive (Blue) route.  Active routes are Red, inactivated routes are Blue.<br>
Right-clicking on a route brings up a focused menu<br>
<img src="images/route_focus3.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="MultipleRoutes">Multiple Routes </h3>

<p>In OpenCPN multiple routes can be handled in a couple of different ways.<br>
Many routes can be created in a session or imported into a session.<br>
The visibility of every route is controlled in the Route Manager. There 
is an "eye" to the far left on the line for each route. This works as a 
toggle switch. A PLAIN  Eye means that the route is visible, while an 
eye with a red cross, means that it's hidden.<br>
This way only the route(s) of interest for the moment can be shown.<br>
<br>
Another way is to create and export routes, and later import them when needed.<br>
To keep the chart clear of useful, but not needed routes follow these steps:<br>
• Create a folder called, 'GPX_Routes', or another suitable name.<br>
• Create your route.<br>
• Use the Route Manager to export the route, with a descriptive file name and save it in GPX_Routes.<br>
• Delete the route from the chart.<br>
• You can export all your routes as one big file or export and delete a route as you create them<br>
• When needed, simply use the Route Managers "Import" Button to open the route file. <br>
 </p>

<p>To get rid of the way points left on the chart when a route has been 
imported and then deleted, which may happen depending on the imported 
gpx file.</p>

<p>1. Open the Route Managers Waypoint tab and press the "Delete All" button<br>
2. Say 'Yes' to: 'Are you sure you want to delete &lt;ALL&gt; waypoints?'</p>

<h3 id="AutopilotsandRoutes">Autopilots and Routes</h3>
If an autopilot output port is defined in  the Options-&gt;Connections 
tab, OpenCPN sends instructions to the A/P when a route is active. 
OpenCPN creates and sends the NMEA RMC sentence to the A/P output  port 
when a route is activated. Read more in <a href="#SettingOptions"><em>Setting Options</em></a>.<br>
OpenCPN automatically shifts to the next waypoint in the route using an 
arrival radius of 0.05 miles (= 92.6 m). This is all automatic and not 
user configurable  or "signal-able".<br>
This works fine in the general case. The A/P is watching the RMB 
strings. It sees a new destination lat/lon, and new heading to steer, 
and then asks the user for confirmation to make the turn. 
Raytheon/Autohelm work this way.<br>

Drop a Man Over Board Marker at your present position by pressing<br>
<strong>* Man Over Board Button</strong> <img src="images/mob_btn.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="32" width="32">  on the ToolBar <br>
or hit the<strong> </strong>Keys<strong> <br>
*Ctrl + Space bar</strong>. <br>
<br>
A mark, looking like the button is instantly created - the MOB mark.<br>
The MOB mark will be called "MAN OVERBOARD at + time-stamp"<br>
<br>
A temporary route, <strong>from </strong>a point 1 mile ahead on the current COG, and <strong>to </strong>the
 MOB mark is created and activated. On the screen, a course and bearing 
to the MOB mark will be displayed. This temporary triangular mark is 
labeled "1.0 NM along COG".<br>
<br>
If COG, course over ground, is not available, no route is created but 
the MOB position is marked. This can happen if no GPS is connected, if 
the GPS signal is (temporary) unavailable or if the speed is so low that
 the GPS doesn't calculate COG.<br>
<br>
<strong>To delete a MOB</strong><br>
The temporary route can be deleted, through the right-click menu, but no
 action of the user with the mouse or keyboard will move or delete the 
MOB mark, except for a right click -&gt; Mark/Wpt Properties and <strong>select a different icon</strong>,
 and then delete the mark (ex mob mark) from the right click menu, or 
through the Route Manager.  A MOB mark is not included in "Delete All" 
in the Toute Manager, to avoid mistakes. The mark has to be selected 
alone and then "Deleted". <br>
<br>
Multiple MOB marks can be deployed, and multiple temporary routes will 
be created. The active route will always be associated with the last 
dropped MOB mark.<br>
<br>
Be very careful when using this capability in waters with strong tide or current.<br>
The person overboard will <strong>not</strong> be at the position of the
 MOB mark for long. Both Own Boat and the person in the water will move 
with the current, but OpenCPN knows nothing about this.<br>
<br>
The MOB mark has just been dropped<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Mob.png" alt="" height="452" width="600"><br>

Own Boat has moved on and the MOB bark is 0.65 miles in bearing 200 degrees. <br>

<br>
<strong>Zoom to Cursor</strong>: Normally when clicking on the screen, 
the display centers on the clicked point. The wheel zooms in/out always 
using the center of the display. With this box ticked,  the zooming 
happens at the point of the cursor. This means that as soon as you start
 to zoom in the cursor stay in the same place on the screen and on 
approximately the same geographical position. The advantage is that the 
zooming in position can be fine tuned just using the cursor.<br>

<br>
<strong>Preserve scale when switching charts:</strong>  Normally when 
switching charts OpenCPN will open the new chart scaled close to it's 
natural scale, the zoom factor stays the same. With this box ticked 
OpenCPN will keep the scale from the last chart, when switching, not 
exactly, but generally of the same magnitude. The zoom-factor will 
increase as you switches to smaller scale charts.<br>

<strong><a name="#"></a>Automatic Daily Tracks</strong>.    <br>
Automatic Daily Tracking ensures that the track-points collected 
throughout a single day (midnight to midnight in local zone time) are 
stored and managed as a single (possibly multi-segment) track.<br>
If the Automatic Daily Tracking check-box is selected, the "Toggle 
Tracking" tool will - as before - turn tracking on and off. However, on 
turning it off, the accumulated track will be extended with the previous
 one, if it does not extend into yesterday. Disjoint segments are kept 
separate, time-adjacent segments are merged into a single segment.<br>
Disjointed track segments, can be joined through the right-click menu, when they are selected in the Route Managers Tracks Tab.<br>
Every Midnight the tracking is turned off and on again automatically, to ensure that the track does not span dates.<br>
If Automatic Daily Tracking is selected during the day, when some tracks
 have already been created, only the last one will be merged with future
 daily tracks.<br>
Assuming Automatic Daily Tracking is on, normally during tracking 
periods there will be two tracks visible in the Route Manager: the 
current track (red color track-points on the chart) and the previously 
accumulated track for the day. After toggling tracking off there will be
 just one track for this day.<br>
If the timezone needs to be changed, it is a good idea to close OpenCPN application before..<br>
With the manual capability of splitting and extending, the daily tracks can be easily managed at any time.<br>
The daily tracks will be automatically named with the date in the local Time Zone, but can of course be changed manually.<br>
The Automatic Daily Tracks follows the settings in <strong>Tracking Precision</strong>, see below.<br>
Without Automatic Daily Tracks selected, OpenCPN handles tracks as before.<br>
<br>
<strong>Highlight Tracks</strong>  shows a 7 to 10m wide highlighting, 
either side of the track. This is not selectable for individual tracks. 
The idea of the highlighting is to remind us that following a previous 
track exposes us to the inherent inaccuracy of GPS, and that the real 
track followed is most likely within the highlight region, but not 
necessarily in the middle. And this says nothing about the accuracy of 
the underlying cartography. For many charts it is prudent to assume at 
least 1.5 mm inaccuracy using the nominal scale of the chart. For a 
chart in scale 1:20,000 this translates to 30m.<br>

<strong>Tracking Precision</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="images/options-Ships6.png" alt="" height="89" width="100"><br>
<br>
With track button in the ToolBar activated this setting affects the size
 of the data saved. It also affects the  "smoothness" of the track, 
though this is only visible when zoomed in to a very large scale.<br>
OpenCPN uses smart dynamic tracking, and only uses those track points 
that actually contributes anything to the track. A straight line track 
for example is only represented by it's endpoints. This is done by 
analyzing the track just behind the boat. The process is visible in real
 time, close to "ownship". The end result is good track accuracy while 
keeping the size small.<br>
<strong>Low:</strong> Good for offshore passages.<br>
<strong>Medium:</strong> Very good for all normal uses.<br>
<strong>High: </strong>Only necessary when very tight maneuvering needs documenting.<br>

OpenCPN version 3.2 features a complete redesign of the NMEA message 
handling structure, including a new GUI and monitor window. This new 
scheme provides extensive NMEA management capabilities, including:<br>
-Input message filtering, by TALKER ID and/or message type.<br>
-Virtually unlimited input port multiplexing, with shared I/O and individual data rate settings.<br>
-Selective message echo capability, similar to third-party mux applications.<br>
-Programmable output port messages, for e.g. autopilot interfaces.<br>
-Full Network input and output, including TCP, UDP, and GPSD services.<br>
-GPSD client support for Windows platforms.<br>
 
<ul>
	<li>All this is different from the logic in earlier versions of 
OpenCPN. In 3.2, there is no defined "autopilot" port. The autopilot is 
simply connected to any available output- enabled datastream, and gets 
everything on the bus, subject to user specified output filtering. There
 is no specific  "shared" AIS and GPS port, as all ports are shared.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img src="images/dataconnections4.png" alt="" height="879" width="600"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li>The key point to keep in mind with this new setup is the complete 
orthogonality between message sources, message destinations, and 
transport media. All messages come and go from an internal "buss", and 
all internal modules have access to all messages. Any message can be 
received, and possibly re-transmitted according to the configuration 
established. If the messages get onto the buss, OpenCPN will do the 
right thing. For example, if it is an AIS message, the AIS module will 
get the message and act accordingly. Plugins also get all messages.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>To get a taste of what can be done, we start with a lab scenario. 
In the screen-shot above, four Data Ports are enabled. GPSD on localhost
 port 2947, /dev/ttyUSB1 as ais port, the San Fransisco AIS feed is next
 and last is an output port to a computer on the local network. Note 
that the connections are automatically sorted in order of the priority 
setting  The picture is from a Linux computer, but the receiving box is 
an Win XP. Both boxes are configured to use the same broadcasting 
address 192.168.0.255(*) on the local network, using the default 10110 
port. Note that UDP, and not TCP, is used. OpenCPN on the XP box 
receives and shows all info from the three first ports and even data 
from the VDR plugin, if it's running. All input sources are merged 
together and available to transmit to an external computer. Every 
computer on-board can be used as a repeater to the main box!</li>
	<li>Note that it's important, in this scenario, that the real NMEA 
sources have a higher priority than the UDP retransmit on te broadcast 
address. The reason is that all hosts on the local network receives a 
broadcast, including the sender, and to avoid eternal source flip-flops 
lower priority is essential.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>(*) There is no advantage with using a broadcast address on the 
local network with just a few computers. It's as easy to just specify 
the addresses of the receiving computers as outgoing connections on the 
transmitting computer. The "receivers" specify the "transmitter" as 
address for a connection.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>In real life, <strong>a common setup</strong> will include input 
from GPS, AIS  and output to an Autopilot. If your GPS produces GPRMC, 
then this will be automatically shipped to the autopilot. Everything on 
the internal multiplex bus will be sent to the output port that the 
autopilot is connected to, even if a route is inactive. If, a route is 
active, OpenCPN will create and send NMEA (EC)RMC sentences to output 
data ports. The only reason OpenCPN "synthesize" an ECRMC sentence is to
 cover those odd cases when there is no other source of RMC in the 
system, and the Autopilot wants variation, SOG, etc. This might be the 
case if an older GPS produces GPGLL alone, for instance, which has no 
var.  There is no "new" information in the transmitted, synthesized 
ECRMC.</li>
	<li>The autopilot might be complaining that it is getting RMC 
information from two different talkers (GP and EC) at the same time, and
 cannot decide what to do. The easiest solution if don't like the ECRMC,
 is to filter it out of the output stream of the port  connected to the 
autopilot. Or choose a filter to allow only GPRMC and ECRMB for this 
port.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Filter NMEA Course and Speed Data:</strong> Providing a 
rolling average of COG/SOG, with configurable sampling period. This 
feature is useful, for example, if you find that course and speed from 
the gps is varying erratically due to the sea state. The Dashboard 
plugin is not affected by this setting  - COG and SOG are updated about 
once per second.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img src="images/Debug_win.png" alt="" height="263" width="800"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Show NMEA Debug Window:</strong> If you check this box you 
will get a window that shows the NMEA data sentences coming into or 
going out from OpenCPN. In the picture above we can see the color-coding
 at work. Messages in red could occur as well, and indicates a transmit 
error. Connections Priority change messages, will also be printed to the
 NMEA Debug Window. The reason that AIVDM messages are both dropped and 
appear as  "Output message", is that there is more than one source for 
this message, and the filter just applies to one source.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><em>Known issues</em>: The pause button only works if the main 
Options dialog is closed. In Linux, the debug window can only be closed 
by unticking the <strong>Show NMEA Debug Window </strong>box, unless the the main Options dialog is closed.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>If there are NMEA sentences in the debug  window, then OpenCPN has opened the port set in the<strong> Data Connections</strong>.
 Note that the source of each NMEA sentence is printed after the time 
stamp o each line. If your GPS port is configured, and there is  no 
"red" boat, then the only reasons are: no gps fix or wrong sentence 
configuration from the GPS.</li>
	<li>Messages originating from GPSD or the VDR (Voyage Data Recorder plugin) will also show up in the debug window.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>For simple NMEA data stream debugging, add the following to your opencpn.ini file:Under [Settings] add a line</li>
</ul>
<em>     DebugNMEA=1500</em><br>
     This will provide up to 1500 debug messages pertaining to NMEA traffic to the <br>
      opencpn.log.<br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Format uploads for Furuno</strong> <strong>GP3X input</strong> <strong>filtering</strong>:
 If  the special Furuno gps protocol is needed, tick this box. The 
reason is that Furuno uses their own version of NMEA for uploading 
routes. Furuno GPS users take note. It is now allowed to use a numeric, 
two digit OpenCPN route name (e.g. 10, 21, etc).</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Use Garmin</strong> <strong>GRMN (Host) mode for uploads.</strong>
 Make sure that  this box is ticked, if you have a Garmin GPS. The 
reason for this is that Garmin units cannot accept route uploads via 
standard NMEA0183. This is a "design feature" of all Garmin receivers.</li>
</ul>
 

<h3 id="DataConnections">Data Connections</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Two Buttons "Add Connections" and "Remove Connections", to the right of the Connections window are the key to this whole tab.</li>
	<li>The enable choice at the start of each connection line, is handy to
 organize connections, but still only use those that are needed for the 
moment. Tick or un-tick, and then press "Apply", to activate the 
setting.</li>
	<li>A connection can be used for input and output at the same time, 
with the reservation that they have to use the same Baud rate. For more 
details, read on. </li>
	<li>When pressing "Add Connections" two basic choices are given, a serial  or a network connection.</li>
</ul>
 

<h3 id="AddaSerialConnection"><strong>Add a Serial Connection</strong></h3>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>DataPort: </strong>Pick a port by pressing the \/ o the 
right side of the field. If the port you are looking for does not appear
 in the selection, write the correct port yourself in this field.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Baud Rate</strong>: This is normally 4800 for GPS and 38400
 for AIS, but check the documentation for the connected device. It's 
important to get this right and not just guess.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: For future use, as only NMEA 0183 works, for now.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Priority</strong>: Higher number equals Higher priority. 
The priority is set for each NMEA sentence individually. As long as a 
higher priority stream is available it's used. If this fails the next 
stream in line, with lower priority, kicks in and is used, until a 
higher priority stream appears. The present filter does not handle the 
case where, for example position messages, are received from different 
sentences.As an example, GPGLL and GPRMC both transmits the position 
information. The last received of either message will be used.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Control Checksum</strong>. At the end of each NMEA sentence
 is a checksum, that makes sure that sentences are correctly received. 
This box is ticked by default, as OpenCPN calculates the checksum and 
compares it to the received checksum. Only sentences with a valid 
checksum are passed through. Un-ticking may help in some cases, for 
example if an application calculates checksums incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Use Garmin</strong> <strong>(GRMN) mode for input:</strong>
 Make sure that  this box is ticked, if you have a Garmin GPS set to 
this mode. The reason is that Garmin uses their own serial protocol.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
 
<h3 id="AddaNetworkConnection"><strong>Add a Network Connection</strong></h3>
<br>
<img src="images/Con-net2.png" alt="" height="237" width="602">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: There are three choices of protocols TCP, UDP and GPSD.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>TCP:</strong> is the standard Internet protocol, and 
sometimes there is no choice. That is the case if you are receiving AIS 
over Internet, for example. If communication with an NMEA-enabled device
 is interactive, connections are usually established on the TCP port 
10110, not on the UDP port. UDP does not establish a session.</li>
	<li>OpenCPN can also work as a TCP server. A suitable setup is a 
connection with the address set to.0.0.0:10110, and output activated. A 
client simply connects to the IP address of the server using the same 
port as the server, 10110 in this case. It is not a good idea to set up a
 connection, to receive on the server address. TCP set up this way 
works, but UDP, described below, is the recommended way.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>UDP</strong><strong>:</strong> This is an ideal protocol 
for local distribution of NMEA data, since it is non-connection 
oriented, so there is no notion of a client and server. It is just a 
stream of data, like NMEA. The messages typically repeat at reasonable 
frequencies, so masking any intermittent transmission errors.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>GPSD:</strong> is a Unix/Linux gps server, which means that
 several different applications can share one gps receiver. Linux users 
have the choice between using serial or GPSD connections for their gps 
input.</li>
	<li>OpenCPN also has support for Windows clients. So a windows computer
 should be able to connect to GPSD running somewhere on a network 
(testing), as an alternative to an UDP connection, described earlier.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Address</strong>: The network address to connect to. In the
 example above we used the broadcast address for convenience, but 
specifying host to send to, and host to receive from, works as well.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Port</strong>: The port to connect to on the network 
address. The default port for UDP is 10110. Port 10110 is designated by 
IANA for "NMEA-0183 Navigational Data". There should not be any reason 
to change this port, but it is possible.  See below. The default port 
for GPSD is 2947. Do not change this!</li>
	<li>For your own local connections use port-numbers greater than 1023 
and avoid ports used by other applications. Ports in the range 49152 
through 65535 are not assigned to other applications and should be OK. 
Make sure that no firewall is blocking the port you pick.</li>

	<li>For each source line in the data connection windows, it's possible 
to specify exactly which NMEA sentences to receive, and which ones to 
drop. Similarly it's possible to control exactly which sentences to send
 out to, for example, an autopilot.</li>
	<li>The applied filters for each connection  are stated in in the 
"Filters" column in the Data Connection window. The default for a 
connection is no filters at all.</li>
	<li>Filtering can be observed in real time, through color coding in the Debug Window.</li>

 be visible on the connection line. For more, see below</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Output on this port (as Autopilot or NMEA repeater )</strong>: Tick this box if the connection will be used for output. A common case is sending NMEA to an <strong>Autopilot</strong>.</li>
	<li>OpenCPN creates and sends the NMEA  ECRMB and ECRMC sentences to the A/P output  port when a route is <strong>activated</strong>. If variation is not otherwise present, OpenCPN includes variation, coming from the WMM plugin, if installed and enabled.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Input Filtering</strong>

	<li>Some examples to illustrate how things works.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3 id="ConnectionNotes"><strong>Connection Notes</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>If a NMEA sentence is filtered on an input connection, it will 
still enter the internal multiplexer. So, it will be available to output
 connections, unless it's filtered there as well. This will only work 
for serial connections. Echoing back a network connection, on the input 
port for output, will not work</li>
	<li><strong>If you do UDP re-broadcasting, then you should set the priority of the "real" NMEA input to something higher than the UDP stream</strong>.
 If not, prepare for problems. The reason is that if you are 
broadcasting, then you yourself will get the UDP message as well, which 
again will be retransmitted...... Obviously, it duplicates the "real" 
incoming data. Thus we get source priority flip-flop on each message, 
since they have the same priority. For example set the UDP priority to 
"0" and real incoming connection to "1" or higher.</li>
	<li>When using an UDP... the UDP address is necessary only for output 
connections, and may be x.x.x.255 for broadcast. On input, it is 
strictly not necessary, but recommended, to specify an address. The port
 is necessary for both input and output, default is 10110.</li>
	<li>NMEA data can also come from the VDR plugin. They will be labeled as such in the Debug Window and have "0" priority.</li>

	<li>The feature "<strong>Send to GPS</strong>", which appears in the right click menus for waypoints and routes and in the Route Manager, is <strong>not</strong>
 linked to connections. The upload port does not even need to appear in 
the Datastream connections list. Its a completely separate <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/concept.html" title="View more discussions on Concept">concept</a>.
 For this reason users must define a separate upload port, that is 
remembered by OpenCPN. The port can be changed by clicking the button in
 the Route Manager.</li>
	<li>NMEA provides no handshake protocol for Route and Waypoint upload. 
So, OpenCPN simply sends the Route/WP information out on the port, 
without having any way to know if there is actually a device connected 
to the port.</li>
	<li>The Garmin protocol does provide handshaking, so OpenCPN can be 
sure that the information is uploaded correctly. The Garmin protocol 
will fail if the device is not a Garmin.</li>
	<li>In the case of standard NMEA, the indication "Route successfully uploaded"<br>
	is not very meaningful. You can say that it just means that a port was found,<br>
	and writing to that port succeeded.</li>
	<li>In the case of "hockey puck" GPS receivers, they probably ignore 
Route and WP uploads, since there is nothing for them to do with this 
information anyway.</li>
	<li>The key to remember is that Route and Waypoint upload process is 
completely independent of normal running Datastream operation. They are 
two separate sub-systems.</li>
	<li>It does no harm to assign the Datastream GPS port as an output and 
input device together. Some users might reasonably expect that this 
would be required for Route and W/P uploads. Most GPS receivers would 
ignore input sentences other than Route and W/P uploads anyway.</li>

  <h1 id="AIS" class="book-heading">AIS</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>For a general introduction to AIS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System">Wikipedia</a> is a good place to start.<br>
The screen-dump below gives you a first feel for how AIS targets are presented and used in OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ais-alarm.png" alt="" height="640" width="800"><br>
<br>
<em>The Lookahead mode is activated here and our own vessel is 
proceeding 352 deg at 13.8 kts, leaving an activated track behind, and 
projecting a dashed line ahead representing the course. This ends in a 
dot, that represents where we will be in 6 minutes, or 1.38 nautical 
miles ahead. We are meeting a vessel, steaming in the opposite direction
 following the traffic separation. This target also has a line and a dot
 in-front of it representing course and where it will be in 6 
minutes(user configurable), and a track behind it.. The two blue dots 
with a red/yellow line between them, represents where the vessels will 
be at CPA - closest point of approach, or when the are nearest each 
other, with present courses and speeds.</em><em> The meeting vessel is red, as it is a potential danger to us.</em> <em>An AIS target alert dialog has just popped up.</em><br>
<br>
There is a lot of information about the vessels that transmits AIS signals.<br>
 </p>

<p class="rteleft"><img src="images/ais11.png" alt="" height="452" width="368"></p>

<p><br>
<em>The cursor is on top of the the meeting vessel on a SW course. As we
 have not yet received full information, this can take a while, we don't
 get the name but an id number, the so called MMSI number, instead. 
Exactly what is shown in the yellow pop-up is configured in the AIS tabs
 Rollover heading.</em><br>
 </p>

<p class="rteleft"><img src="images/ais2.png" alt="" height="308" width="356"></p>

<p> </p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>This vessel is identified by name, and has a green color, as it does not represent any danger to our navigation.</em><br>
 </p>

<p class="rtecenter"> </p>

<p class="rteleft"><img src="images/AISTargetQuery.png" alt="" height="402" width="328"></p>

<p><em>If we instead of just hovering the cursor on an object, double 
click it, the  dialog above pops up. A lot of relevant information is 
displayed. TCPA is the time until CPA, how long before we are at the 
closest point to the other vessel.</em><br>
<br>
<img src="images/aisfocus.png" alt="" height="135" width="183"><br>
<br>
<em>Right-clicking a target brings up a dialog focused on AIS.</em><br>
<br>
 </p>

<h3 id="TheAISTargetList">The AIS Target List</h3>
<br>
<img src="images/AIS-list.png" alt="" height="443" width="750"><br>
Another way to present the AIS information. The AIS target list is 
available through the right click menu.  Click on the header in a column
 to sort according to this criteria. For example, clicking "Range" sorts
 the targets with the nearest target on top. Click one more time to get 
the target, furthest away on top.<br>
Active Search And Rescue Target (<strong>SART</strong>) and Digital Selective Calling (<strong>DSC</strong>) distress targets, will always stay at the top of the list, even when sorting.<br>
AIS targets  with Lat &gt; +/-85 deg will show brg "unavailable". OpenCPN is not suited for Polar Navigation.<br>
<strong>Target Info</strong><em> </em>button<em>: </em>Click on a target to highlight it and then click the button  to display the information dialog.<br>
<strong>Center View</strong> button: Highlight a target an click this button and the screen will center on the target.<br>
<strong>Limit Range</strong>: The list will only show targets with a range less than, or equal to this value. <br>
<strong>Target Count:</strong> Total number of AIS targets.<br>
 
<h3 id="AIS Transponder and Ownship.">AIS Transponder and Ownship.</h3>

<p>OpenCPN 3.2 does not show the ownship (i.e. AIVDO message) neither as
 an AIS target, nor in the target list. AIVDO is processed only in the 
main navigation thread. <br>
Earlier releases did show ownship, but this was a bug, simply an illusion.<br>
The earlier presence of AIVDO (ownship) information in the data stream, 
really only indicated  that the transponder was turned on and received 
GPS signals. The only true way to <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/monitor.html" title="View more discussions on Monitor">monitor</a> the output of a transponder, is with a separate AIS receiver.</p>

<h3 id="AISdataport"><strong>AIS data port</strong></h3>

<p>Select your AIS input port in the Connection Tab. The AIS button in 
the ToolBar, appears different according to the following conditions.<br>
  <img src="images/ais.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Alive. The default AIS button. This icon appears as soon as an AIS 
port is active in the tool-box. It is also the normal state with an AIS 
receiver working and with no targets of interest.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ais_alive_active.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">AIS
 Alive and Activity, a small green circle will illuminate in the lower 
right corner of the Ais buton. If there is at least one AIS message 
every 4 seconds, the light will remain illuminated.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ais_supressed.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Suppressed. This icon indicates only that target suppression is 
activated in the AIS tab in the ToolBox. Referring to the picture above 
there are two sort of suppression:<br>
* Suppress display of all moored/anchored targets, max speed specified in dialog.<br>
* Suppress Alerts for moored/anchored targets.<br>
This icon will be over-ridden with the AIS alarm button if an alarm is, 
or becomes, active according to the AIS tab alarms settings in the 
toolbox.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ais_alarm.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Alarm. A target exist that raises the alarm as defined in the AIS 
tab in the ToolBox. It is the three settings "CPA Calculations", that 
rules if and when an alarm is raised.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/ais_disabled.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Disabled. No targets, if available, are shown on the screen. This 
button toggles with the other buttons. For example, if the AIS alarm 
button is visible, click the button and it will change to the "AIS 
Disabled" button, and all targets, alarms etc, disappears from the 
display. Click again and the original button and AIS display comes back.</p>

<div class="rteleft"><img src="images/Ships_aistargets.png" alt="" height="880" width="682"></div>

<p class="rtecenter"> </p>

<p class="rteleft">This tab controls the behavior of many thing in the 
AIS display. There are no "best" settings. It all depend on where you 
are, what kind of navigation you are into and what kind of vessel you 
are on. It is your responsibility to evaluate this.<br>
<br>
<strong>CPA calculation</strong>: Rules for when the Closest Point of 
Approach- CPA (when two vessels are nearest each other) is calculated 
and when warnings are activated. <br>
There are three tick boxes, which can be activated with user set values.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> If the vessel is far away it is less interesting to 
calculate CPA. In a busy waterway this could cut down on clutter and 
processing speed if a reasonable value is set.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Similar arguments to No 1. This controls when a 
warning for minimum CPA distance is given. A warning can be both on the 
screen and a sound. The CPA is shown on the screen when a warning is 
active.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Similar to No 2 this controls the alarm based on a minimum time to CPA.<br>
If a target is within the distance set in #1 and  without an active 
warning, theCPA can bi shown anyway through right-clicking on the 
target.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/TargetCPA.png" alt="" height="135" width="183"><br>
<br>
"Show Target CPA" toggles with "Hide Target CPA"<br>
<br>
<a href="#MoreAboutTargetCPA"><em>More About Target CPA</em></a>, a few more tricks are available.<br>
<br>
<strong>Lost Targets:</strong> Rules for how lost targets should be handled on the display.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> Target is regarded as lost if no transmission are 
received for the number of minutes set here, the target will change on 
the display and have a black bar across.<img src="images/ais-lost.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="51" width="51"><br>
<strong>2.</strong> The lost target will be removed from the display after the number of minutes set here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Display:</strong> If and how a vessels course and speed should be displayed and if stationary vessels should be on the screen.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> An arrow will be shown in front of the vessel 
representing it's COG (Course Over Ground). The length of this arrow and
 the dot at the end of it represents the calculated position in the 
number of minutes set here. Set easily calculated values. If a vessel 
approaches you doing 15 kts and the time is set to 6 minutes, the dot 
will be 1.5 nautical miles ahead of the vessel.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> A track will be shown behind a target. This helps to judge the target vessels intentions.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/trail.png" alt="" height="213" width="600"><br>
<br>
<strong>3.</strong> An anchored or moored target <img src="images/ais-moor.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="50" width="50">
  will not be displayed if the speed is less than the value set here. 
This "Navigational Staus" is set by the ships and may not be correct.<br>
Be aware that the COG arrow will not be shown for any target with a COG 
less than this value, hence it's important to enter a very low value.<br>
<br>
<strong>4.</strong> <strong>Show Area Notices</strong>. More about <a href="#AISAreaMessages"><em>AIS Area Messages</em></a> here.<br>
<strong>5.</strong> <strong>Show AIS targets real size</strong>. Zooming in on a target will eventually show a rectangle using the real size , if available. <br>
<img src="images/real-size.png" alt="" height="410" width="700"><br>
<br>
<strong>Rollover:</strong> Tick the boxes for the kind of information 
shown when hovering with the cursor over a target. This is what you get 
with all the settings  ticked.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="images/rollover.png" alt="" height="214" width="466"></p>

<p class="rteleft"><br>
<strong>CPA/TCPA Alerts:</strong> When an alert is triggered, a jagged 
circle in red is drawn around the target that set off the alarm. 
Additional events can be set here, drawing more attention to the alarm. 
For practical navigation, make sure your alarm sound is set.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> Shows an alert dialog on the screen with target information when an alarm is triggered.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Sounds an alarm when an alarm is triggered.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Don't show alarms for anchored and moored targets.<br>
<br>
<strong>Select Alert Sound.</strong> Select an alarm that suits you. 
This alarm will also be used if an anchor watch is set. Due to copyright
 issues, only a few sound files are included. Users can add their own 
generic ".wav" sound files. The location for these files are  
"/usr/local/share/opencpn/sounds/" on Linux and typically C:\Program 
Files\OpenCPN\sounds on Windows XP.<br>
<br>
<strong>Test Alert Sound.</strong> Test the selected sound and make sure this important feature is working<br>
<br>
<strong>Enable Target Alert Acknowledge timeout</strong>. Once a target alert is acknowledged, wait the set number of minutes before the alert comes up again (if still applicable).</p>

<p class="rteleft">.</p>

<h3 id="When exactly is an alarm activated?"><br>
<strong>When exactly is an alarm activated?</strong></h3>

<p class="rteleft">An alert is set off if your boat is approaching the 
CPA, the blue dot on the extension of the course line, and the 
previously discussed set of conditions are met. Once the distance to the
 CPA increases, this happens when the involved vessels has passed each 
other, the alarm stops, even if the other conditions still apply. </p>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><em>The US FCC has recently approved 
transmissions by AIS SART devices.   These devices were originally 
designed for SOLAS class ships as an  alternative to radar SARTs for 
carriage on life boats, but the  efficiency of design has encouraged 
applications down to man-over-board  devices</em>. (<a href="http://www.exactearth.com/media-centre/exactblog/">www.exactearth.com/media-centre/exactblog</a>,<span><span>May 3, 2012</span></span>)<br>
<br>
Search And Rescue Transponders (SART) or an EPIRB, transmitting AIS 
messages are now available on the market. In an emergency situation the 
position  will be displayed as an AIS target in  OpenCPN. AIS SART can 
be a device on a vessel, in a life raft or a personal Man Over Board 
(MOB) device. The common thing is that the icon below marks an <strong>emergency</strong>.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/SART4.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="41" width="45"> SART icon, <strong>distress</strong> target display. <strong>This is a "Mayday".</strong><br>
<br>
On OpenCPN a distress signal sent by a  SART, triggers an visual alert 
and a warning sound, if this is activated in the ToolBox--&gt;AIS Tab.  
 <br>
<br>
<img src="images/SARTalarm.png" alt="" height="377" width="600"><br>
<br>
Once the alert is "Acknowledged", the target behaves as any other AIS 
target. In the picture below the cursor is over the target.<br>

And here is an AIS target query.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/SART3.png" alt="" height="310" width="400"><br>

Many countries around the maritime world are testing the AIS binary messages. Expect a lot of development in this area.<br>
<br>
In OpenCPN, this is very much a work in progress, the areas were only added  April 2012 and the messages in December 2012.<br>
<br>
Areas and the messages included for each area, are available. <br>
In the US, Cape Cod is transmitting experimental Right Whale information. For testing, copy <a href="http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm">vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm</a> into a text file and point the VDR (Voyage Data Recording) plugin to this file.<br>

query for vectorcharts. The easiest way to display this dialog  is to 
just double click in an area. The screen picture above shows that this 
works for RNC:s (raster charts) as well as ENC:s (vector charts). The 
first notice above is for the yellow tinted rectangular area while he 
second notice is for one of the circles outlined in green.<br>

  <h1 id="MoreAboutTargetCPA" class="book-heading">More About Target CPA</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->OpenCPN displays warnings about 
targets CPA &amp; TCPA according to the setup in the AIS tab. But it's 
also possible to show CPA &amp; TCPA for any target, that is no 
immediate danger, but where internal CPA calculation is still done, to 
assist in the decision making.<br>
<br>
The AIS rollover window shows the CPA and TCPA of a target :<br>
<br>
<img src="images/0.png" alt="" height="128" width="321"><br>
<br>
But it doesn't tell us <strong>where we and the target are at CPA</strong>, and if the target passes in front of us or behind us (i.e. should we speed up or slow down ?).<br>
<br>
See the following (real) example:<br>
We are sailing hard on the wind, while a vessel is approaching us, more 
or less from the wind direction. A CPA of 0.78 miles is normally safe, 
but there is this island in our way, meaning we had to tack towards the 
vessel, and it is still 14 minutes to go ...<br>
<br>
<img src="images/2.png" alt="" height="551" width="750"><br>
<br>
What will happen with our CPA  after the tack ?<br>
Have we already passed each other or do we get closer when tacking just in front of the island ?<br>
The answer to these questions is a context sensitive menu for AIS targets. Move the<br>
mouse over the target, and when you see the CPA / TCPA info in the rollover window,<br>
<br>
<img src="images/3.png" alt="" height="82" width="285"><br>
<br>
you can right click and select “Show AIS Target CPA”.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/4.png" alt="" height="189" width="186"><br>
<br>
The function is only available when we have a “valid CPA”, i.e. when the rollover shows<br>
CPA and TCPA (it uses the internal CPA calculation).<br>
<br>
It simply shows the “CPA line” which is used in case of a CPA alert :<br>
<br>
<img src="images/2.png" alt="" height="551" width="750"><br>
<br>
Showing the CPA-line as in the screen-shot above, makes life much easier. Nothing to worry about ...<br>
<br>
At CPA ...<br>
• we will be just in front of the island, exactly at our tacking position and<br>
• she'll already be behind us (CPA line points backwards from our CPA position)<br>
The CPA line is constantly updated, so you can follow the situation.<br>
<br>
This is, what it looked like directly after our tack<br>
<br>
<img src="images/5.png" alt="" height="301" width="241"><br>
<br>
To get rid of the CPA line for a specific target, right-click on the target and select “Hide AIS Target CPA”.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/6.png" alt="" height="187" width="186"><br>
<br>
As already mentioned, the CPA line is shown only, when there is a valid CPA.<br>
A minute later, we don't have a CPA anymore for the target --&gt; the CPA line isn't drawn anymore !.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/7.png" alt="" height="274" width="354"><br>
<br>
Another example :<br>
<br>
<img src="images/8.png" alt="" height="415" width="503"><br>
<br>
He'll pass behind us, so “full steam ahead !”<br>
<br>
<strong>Monitoring several targets</strong><br>
You can also monitor more than one target in parallel. Simply right-click on a second target and “Show AIS target CPA line”<br>
Situation could be :<br>
What happens to a second target if I get out of the way of the first one ?<br>

For the basics of marks se this page:  <a href="#MarksandRoutes"><em>Marks and Routes </em></a><br>
<br>
The properties of Extended marks described on this page expands the use of marks.<br>
It is now possible, for example, to make a interactive Cruising Pilot.<br>
An extended mark is sometimes called a <strong>POI</strong>, a point of interest.<br>
<br>
The "Mark/WP Properties" looks like this for a default mark.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/default-mark.png" alt="" height="567" width="550"><br>
<br>
The dialog is available by double-clicking the mark, in the right-click menu or through the Route Manager.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Basic tab.</strong><br>
<strong>Name</strong>: Give the mark a suitable name. This will be visible on the chart, but can be hidden by un-ticking the <strong>Show Name</strong> box.<br>
<strong>Icon</strong>: Change the default icon for the mark. Only the "Name" will be displayed if selecting the "Empty" icon.<br>
<strong>The position of the mark</strong>: You can drag the mark with the mouse to the desired position or enter the correct <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> in these fields.<br>
Right clicking anywhere in the latitude or longitude display gives you 
the sub dialog shown above. Latitude and longitude can be copied 
separately or together. A copied lat/long will be available in the paste
 buffer, and will be displayed if you activate the "Jump to position..."
 dialog. It is also possible to paste a position. A Paste will try to be
 smart about parsing the format, and accepts a lot of different 
syntaxes. Even the GPX <b><font face="Courier New">&lt;wpt lat="0.00" long="0.00"&gt;</font></b> should work.<br>
<strong>Description</strong>: Enter anything about the mark. Long descriptions can be read easier by switching to the <strong>Description Tab</strong>. See examples below.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/mark2.png" alt="" height="489" width="500"><br>
<br>
<img src="images/mark3.png" alt="" height="489" width="500"><br>
<br>
<strong>Links</strong>: Marks can, as an option, have embedded links to 
the Internet or the the local computer.  These are either opened in the 
default browser or through the default application, for example for 
pictures or pdf files.<br>
For security reasons, the links does not work for launching other programs.<br>
<br>
Create a link by pressing <strong>Add</strong>. Give the link a good description in the new dialog. <br>
Enter an Internet address in <strong>URL</strong> or find a local file through the button <strong>Local File..</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="images/mark8.png" alt="" height="489" width="500"><br>
<br>
The new link will appear under <strong>Links</strong>. Add more links as required.<br>
<strong>Edit</strong> links by pressing the "Edit" button. The 
description will change from "Links are opened in the default browser." 
to " Links are opened for editing" when the button is pressed. The color
 of the "Edit" button gets a grayer shade when it is pressed down. Press
 once more to release the button. Press once - the button is down. Press
 again - the button is released and goes up.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/mark6.png" alt="" height="180" width="500"><br>

In the illustrated case, the link was to a local JPG picture, that opens
 in the default program associated with the jpg extension.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/mark4.png" alt="" height="601" width="700"><br>

<strong>The Description Tab</strong><br>
This is simply an expanded view of the Description box in the Basic tab.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Extended Tab</strong><br>
<strong>Show on Chart</strong>: Untick this box, and the mark will not 
show on the chart. To make it visible again, use the Route Managers 
Waypoint Tab. Click the "Icon" column, to the far left, on the line with
 the waypoint.<br>

	<li><strong>All Navigation Objects</strong> on this page, except for "Temporary Layers", <strong>are persistent </strong>between sessions. More here:<a href="#NavigationDataBackup"><em>Navigation Data Backup</em></a></li>
	<li><strong>All objects visibility </strong>is toggled by clicking the "eye", or other icon, to the left of the route/track/waypoint name on each line.</li>
	<li><strong>All objects can be sorted</strong> by the header in the 
columns in the Manager. By clicking "Route Name below, the routes will 
be sorted alphabetically, pressing once again reverses the order. 
Similar for the column "To", the destination.</li>

	<li>Click the "eye" to the far left on the line with the route to 
toggle if the route is displayed or hidden on the chart. A small dialog 
let you choose, if  existing marks, included in a route, will also 
become invisible. Once a route is deleted, such a mark will go back to 
be a "normal" waypoint.</li>
	<li>To Sort routes click "Route Name" or "To"</li>
	<li><strong>Properties</strong>:This button brings up a new dialog with settings that can be changed for each route.</li>
	<li><img src="images/Route-Properties.png" alt="" height="385" width="600"></li>
	<li>Wpt 005 is right-clicked, and new dialog has popped up. The 
waypoint properties can be reached and edited. For example, change the 
default name, "005" in this case, to something more appropriate. Read 
more in the <a href="#ExtendedMarks"><em>Extended Marks</em></a> 
section. The waypoint can also be deleted. The last entry, "Copy all as 
text" copies all Route Properties for pasting into a text or Spreadsheet
 document.</li>
	<li><img src="images/Route-Properties1.png" alt="" height="230" width="600"></li>
	<li><strong>Plan Speed</strong> The overall planned speed for the 
route. The speed for each leg can be set by going to the waypoint 
Properties-&gt;Description tab for the waypoint that starts the leg, and
 write in the speed. For example " VMG=9.7".<em> [Unfortunately this approach presently excludes writing descriptions for the waypoint. One or the other, be warned!</em>]</li>
	<li><strong>Departure Time</strong>:With no departure time the ETE 
(Estimated Time En route) is calculated. Enter a Departure Time and the 
ETA will be calculated. Make sure to press "Enter/Return" after entering
 a departure time. This guarantees that the entered time is used in 
calculations.<br>
	To enter the present time, enter  "&gt;" (meaning: "Now") in the 
departure time box. This works provided "Time shown as" -&gt; Local@PC  
is selected. Press "Enter" and all the times in the "ETA" column will 
change. "&gt;" differs from entering the same tim manually, say 
"5/23/2011 08:00":<br>
	 - "5/23/2011 08:00" - calculates departure at 0800 on May 23rd 2011 from the first waypoint of the route<br>
	 - "&gt;" - issued at 0800 on May 23rd 2011 - calculates departure Now 
from the current boat position, including the distance to the first 
waypoint of the route</li>
	<li><strong>Times shown as:</strong> UTC is a new name for GMT. LMT is a
 local mean time based on the present longitude. For Local Zone Time one
 can also enter the keyword "now".</li>
	<li><strong>Color:</strong><em> </em>Set the displayed color of the track or keep the default<em>.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Style:</strong> Solid, dashes, dots, a combination or keep the default.</li>
	<li><strong>Width:</strong> Set the width of the track or keep or keep the default.</li>
	<li>Marking a  line with the leg number and the destination Waypoint in
 the Properties Dialog also marks the Waypoint on the chart with a blue 
square.<img src="images/bluesquare.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="38" width="40"></li>
	<li><img src="images/printroute.png" alt="">  The  lower part of the Route properties dialog now has a <strong>Print Route</strong> button. It is possible to first select what features to print before being sent to the normal print routine.</li>
	<li><strong>Extend Route</strong>:Extending is possible only when it is
 obvious, what should be joined with the current route (current = 
visible in the Dialog). Eligible are all visible route points shared 
with, or lying nearby to the current route's endpoint. If there is 
exactly 1 such point, then it is considered obvious, and the Extend 
button is enabled. If there are more, some should be hidden before 
proceeding, until just 1 remains.<br>
	Routes are extended <em> forward</em>, based on the geographic 
location, next route point must be very near, as when mouse-extending 
the route. If the next route point is to far away for extending, just 
create the joining leg and extend twice.</li>
	<li><strong>Split Route:</strong>For splitting, the split point is 
selected as the row in the listing. The point-of-split becomes part of 
both new routes (shared) or tracks (cloned). Original route/track is 
deleted.</li>
	<li>Here is a basic example of first splitting then extending. The test route is shown below</li>
	<li><img src="images/orig.png" alt="" height="455" width="421">"Split Test_A"</li>
	<li>In the Route Managers property dialog for the route we have 
selected a waypoint where we would like to split the route. The "Split 
Test" Route now consists of two parts, that has been renamed.</li>
	<li><img src="images/orig1.png" alt="" height="359" width="600"></li>
	<li>Next we extend the first leg "Split Test_A" with the second leg 
"Split Test_B". This extended route s now named "Split Test_B_plus.</li>
	<li><img src="images/orig2.png" alt="" height="316" width="600"></li>
	<li><strong>Activate/Deactivate</strong>: Activates/Deactivates a route marked in the left part of the window.</li>
	<li><strong>Zoom to</strong>: Zooms in on a route marked in the left part of the window.</li>
	<li><strong>Reverse</strong>: Reverses a selected route.</li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Deletes selected route or track. Use the 
Shift key to mark multiple routes for deletion. This also work in the 
other Route manager tabs.</li>
	<li><strong>Export Route</strong>: Save the route on your computer for later use (import)</li>
	<li><strong>Send to GPS.</strong> Send the Route to your GPS. Pressing 
the button activates a dialog were an output port is selected. This port
 does not have to be listed in "Connnections" as it is an independent 
feature. This choice also appears in the right click menu for routes and
 waypoints.  For <strong>Garmin Users</strong>, make sure that the 
ToolBox-&gt;GPS-&gt;"Use Garmin GRMN/GRMN(Host) mode for Waypoint and 
Route uploads" box is ticked. The reason for this is that Garmin units 
cannot accept route uploads via NMEA0183. This is a "design feature" of 
all Garmin receivers.<img src="images/Route23.png" alt="" height="252" width="500"></li>
	<li><strong>Delete All</strong>. Be careful. If you <strong>know</strong>
 you have saved the routes on your computer and are able to import the 
again, this is a simple way to clear the screen from routes. Better be 
safe than sorry, so save before deleting, if you want to be able to use 
the routes again.</li>
	<li><strong>Import</strong>. Import one or more previously saved Routes. It is possible to select and import multiple routes.</li>
	<li>Export All, now called "<strong>Export All Visible...</strong>"  Saves all visible routes, waypoints and layers, in one gpx file. This is done through a normal file saving dialog.</li>
	<li>If a Tidal Height Curve Dialog, for an individual tidal station is 
 shown on the screen, the tidal situation for this station will be 
tabulated along all route points in the route properties dialog. It is 
essential to enter a departure time and a planned speed. Once "Enter" is
 pressed the tidal column will show the nearest High or Low water 
considering the ETA at each waypoint.<br>
	  <img src="images/plan1.png" alt="" height="455" width="600"><br>
	  <img src="images/plan2.png" alt="" height="292" width="600"></li>
	<li>If no tide dialog for any station is open and a waypoints name 
contains the string @~~&lt;name&gt;, for example "@~~York Spit Light", 
then the tide report for the closest station with matching name is shown
 in the tide column for this waypoint. The most appropriate tidal 
station for each waypoint can thus be selected.</li>
	<li>When entering a departure time the ETA, Expected Time of Arrival will be shown, instead of ETE, Expected Time En-route.</li>
	<li>The individual waypoints "Description" field can contain the 
setting of planned speed specific just to the next route leg (e.g. 
"VMG=4.5;") and/or the specification of Estimated Time of Departure from
 this waypoint (e.g. " ETD=2/14/2011 12:00;"), allowing for planning 
extended stopovers. Time can be specified as UT, LMT or local zone time 
at the PC (default).<br>
	 <img src="images/plan5.png" alt="" height="283" width="600"></li>
	<li>Make sure that you have read all about Automatic Daily tracks and track Highlighting in the Documentation for the <a href="http://opencpn.org/toolbox_settings#auto-track"><em>Toolbox Settings</em></a></li>
	<li>The visibility of tracks is controlled by clicking the "eye" on each line. Tracks can be sorted by clicking the column headers.</li>
	<li>Tracks are extended <em>backward,</em> based on the time-stamp 
sequence, a track is selected, which ends as the latest one before the 
start of current track. Tracks are extended as a single segment if they 
share the extending point. If they ha no common point  a new "empty" 
segment, with no visible track, is added. Joining two tracks (i.e. 
extending a track) results in just  track one remaining. It may look 
like two tracks but the Route Manager treats it as a single track.</li>
	<li>"Merge Selected Tracks" is an alternative to "Extend Track", where 
tracks are joined. The difference is that Merged tracks are visibly 
joined by straight track-lines. Read on for instructions on merging 
tracks.</li>
	<li>If you have ever hit the Track icon by mistake, or closed down 
OpenCPN in the middle of a passage, you know that it's very frustrating 
it is, to have a voyage split up in a number of different tracks that 
does not come together.</li>
	<li>This can be fixed. Just select any number of tracks in the Track 
tab of the Route Manager window, right click the mouse to bring up the 
context menu, and choose to Merge Selected Tracks. The selected tracks 
will be merged in chronological order, with the track properties (name, 
color etc) of the resulting track keeping those of the earliest track in
 the selection.</li>

update charts with new navigation marks and dangers as per Notices to 
Mariners, and to add Radio Call-In Points or to build a database of 
lights and locations, that will be visible on chart regardless of 
current scale. See the first picture above, where French and UK forecast
 areas are good examples of Layers. In the second picture, a very good 
celestial fix, plotted with a gpx script has been saved as a layer.</li>
	<li>More advanced uses could for example be an interactive cruising 
guide, using the possibility to embed links in waypoint descriptions.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Layers are immutable, nothing can be changed. This could make them 
confusing, unless you are aware of the fact that they are .... layers!</li>
	<li>To see if a waypoint, route or track, is a part of a layer, 
right-click the object. If it is part of a layer, the context sensitive 
menu will say so. Alternatively, open properties and check the top of 
the dialog, if part of a layer, the layers name is printed. As 
always,double clicking on a object, directly brings up the properties 
dialog,

	<img src="images/layer_route1.png" alt="" border="10" height="80" width="200"></li>
	<li>A Route belonging to a layer also has the option "Activate". It can
 thus be used, but still, no changes can be made. A much more flexible 
option, would be to import the route layer file as a normal gpx file.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="HandlingLayers">Handling Layers</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Layers can be created in OpenCPN,  and saved as a gpx file, or be created offline, manually or by scripts, for example.</li>
	<li>Layers that are saved in a directory called "layers", in the same 
place that holds your opencpn.ini(config) file, are automatically loaded
 on start of OpenCPN. These layers will be listed in the Route Managers 
Layers Tab on start up. The first time they will all be visible. Adjust 
visibility by clicking on the "eye" in the first column. This setting 
will be remembered. Have a look at the first picture on this page!</li>
	<li>The easiest way to find this directory is to go to the <img src="images/help.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="31" width="28"> - button in the ToolBar and look all the way down in the first tab (About).<br>
	In Linux create the directory: /home/$USER/.opencpn/layers.</li>
	<li><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">On </span><span class="hps">Mac</span> <span class="hps">OS</span> <span class="hps">X, the location</span> <span class="hps">is "/</span><span class="hps">Users</span><span class="hps">/</span>"<span class="hps">user</span> <span class="hps">name"</span><span class="hps">/Library</span><span class="hps">/Preferences</span><span class="hps">/User</span> <span class="hps">Icons"</span><span>.</span> <span class="hps">Note</span><span> that </span></span><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">"library</span><span>" is a hidden directory in</span></span><span id="result_box" lang="en"> <span class="hps">"Lion</span><span>"</span><span>.</span></span></li>
	<li>Any subdirectories in the layers directory,  are also loaded.</li>
	<li>Layers worth keeping, could be kept in the mentioned "layers" 
directory and  visibility during a session can be handled through "Hide 
from Chart" or "Show on Chart" buttons. New layers, gpx files, can 
easily be added in a subdirectory of it's own.</li>
	<li>A few restrictions apply to layer marks. A layer mark cannot be 
used to set anchor-watch on. If right-click-selecting co-located 
objects, priority is given to non-layer objects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="TheRouteManagersLayerTab">The Route Managers Layer Tab</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Temporary layer</strong>: Any gpx file can be imported as a
 layer. This can be used for developing layers, or for import from a 
user defined directory with predefined layers, as necessary. Layers 
imported this way will be saved when closing down the computer, they are
 persistent. More permanent layers should be kept in the "layers" 
directory, as described above.</li>
	<li><strong>Delete: </strong>Unloads the layer, but doesn't of course 
touch the originally imported gpx file. A progress bar will appear when 
deleting large layers. It is not possible to stop the deletion, once 
started. For size restrictions, see below.</li>
	<li><strong>Hide from Chart</strong> or <strong>Show on Chart</strong> 
Controls if the marked layer is visible. The same thing can be achieved 
by clicking the "eye" to the left of the layers name. A red X across the
 eye marks a hidden layer. See picture above. These settings are 
persistent, they will be remembered after a restart.</li>
	<li><strong>Hide WPT Names</strong> Shows a visible layer without waypoint names. This helps to un-clutter layers, when zoomed out.</li>
	<li><strong>List contents </strong>or <strong>Delist Contents  </strong>Listing is this context means showing the individual points in the layer as waypoints in the "Waypoints Tab"</li>
	<li><strong>Import GPX..</strong> and <strong>Export All..</strong> <strong>Warning</strong>
 these buttons has nothing to do with Layers. They work as if you are in
 an other tab. For import use "Import New Layers". For export, create 
layers as described above.</li>
	<li><strong>Export All Visible</strong>.. exports all visible layers, 
routes and waypoints to a gpx file. Use this button to create new 
layers, for example. Just save the gpxfile in the right place, described
 above. Note that "visible" in this context is the opposite to a layer, 
route or waypoint being "hidden". This means that objects not visible on
 the screen, may be included.</li>
	<li>A progress bar will appear when exporting large layers. It is not 
possible to stop the deletion, once started. For size restrictions, see 
below.</li>
	<li>If a layer includes extended marks, linked to pictures, for 
example, the pictures will not be exported, only the links to the 
pictures. To "export" the whole layer to another computer, copy all the 
pictures separately. Adjust all the links in the gpx file, to the new 
computer, by doing a "search and replace" in a text editor on the new 
computer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="SizeLimitsfortheLayerfeature">Size Limits for the Layer feature</h3>

<ul>
	<li>OpenCPN is presently not suited to handle very large permanent 
layer files. Exporting and deleting such layers bogs down the program. A
 few hundred Kb is OK, a 1 Mb file is barely acceptable, while a 10 Mb 
gpx file, certainly is way to big. With older hardware or limited 
available memory, even these recommendations may be to optimistic.</li>
</ul>

  <h1 id="Great-circle Sailing" class="book-heading">Great-circle Sailing</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
Very few cruising boats needs to use Great-circles, but it's certainly 
an important consideration for commercial vessels across the North 
Atlantic and North Pacific. <br>
The advantage of a great circle is obvious, the shorter distance. The 
disadvantages, depending on latitude, could be quite a few. Colder 
weather, stronger winds, higher seas and perhaps even icebergs.  The 
great circle is just one factor in the decision making, when planning  a
 route, the weather is likely to be the deciding factor in most cases.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN has a builtin Great-circle tool as well as a Great-circle plugin.<br>
<br>
<strong>The built in </strong><strong>Great-circle tool.</strong><br>
The "Measure" tool in the right-click menu and the "Create Route" button
 on the ToolBar switches seamlessly to a great circle mode when asked to
 do long distance tasks. This mainly happens when using these tools in 
some east-west direction and far away from the equator. The mode kicks 
in when the difference between the normal, rhumb line and the great 
circle becomes larger than two nautical miles. This will be some 0.2% to
 0.5% of the total distance, depending on latitude and direction.  When 
this happens a clear curve towards the  pole will appear.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/pencil.png" alt="" height="45" width="45"><br>
The Measure Tool<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc7.png" alt="" height="206" width="500"><br>
<br>
Testing the measure tool for Manila to San Francisco (approximately). 
For a good illustration to Great-circles, find a second point that is 
opposite the first, on the other side of the globe, and just move around
 slightly.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc6.png" alt="" height="213" width="500"><br>
<br>
Once the first leg in measuring is done, it's plotted as a rhumb-line, 
to keep things simple. The active leg is still displayed as a 
Great-circle, if long enough. The distance displayed is the combined 
Great-circle distances.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/route.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"><br>
<br>
The "Create Route" Tool<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc1.png" alt="" height="220" width="450"><br>
<br>
If you answer no to the above question, OpenCPN will use a traditional 
rhumb line for the leg. Answering yes, will kick the Great-circle option
 into action and a number of intermediary waypoint points will be 
created. There will be at least 3 waypoints. The exact number of 
waypoints is calculated by OpenCPN and is appropriate for most cases.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc4.png" alt="" height="117" width="450"><br>
<br>
The created route is now available in the RouteManager dialog, as a normal route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc8.png" alt="" height="152" width="500"><br>
<br>
As a real example let us looka at a route from Mossel Baai South Africa,
 to the western entrance to Investigator Strait South Australia. The 
Rhumbline is 5660 mautilcal miles, and the Great-circle, as approximated
 by the created route is 5249 miles. The "real" Great-circle is som 15 
miles shorter.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc3.png" alt="" height="157" width="500"><br>
<br>
<strong>Composite Saling</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="images/composite.png" alt="" height="147" width="500"><br>
<br>
Composite sailing is a Great-circle sailing with a maximum allowed 
latitude. OpenCPN has no such built option, but it's easy to create. <br>
Above is the same route as before designed for composite sailing, not going further south than 45<span class="st">° S latitude. Start a route at Mossel Baai extend it until 45</span><span class="st">° S becomes a tangent to the visible Great-circle. End the route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/composite1.png" alt="" height="204" width="500"><br>
<br>
Do the same thing, starting with the destination and going backwards. Create a rhumbline route, using the two point along 45</span><span class="st">° S.</span> The three routes together is the composite route. The total distance of the composite route is 5293 Nautical Miles.<br>
<a name="#"></a><br>
<h3 id="RoutePlugin"><strong>Route Plugin</strong></h3>
<br>
"Salty Paws" route plugin handles much more than Great circles, introduced here.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/route_plugin.png" alt="" height="415" width="500"><br>
<br>
The plugin have a few features not present in the built-in tool. It can 
calculate a composite route, and the distance between the waypoints can 
be set by the user. The end result, however, is a "gpx" file that is 
exported, and then imported into OpenCPN via the Route Manager.<br>

How to use split and extend - an example.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt.png" alt="" height="284" width="600"><br>
<br>
Hm...a bit of a miss in the planning. An islet with a shallow bank 
extending southward on our route. We put two marks north of the 
obstruction and would like to include these in our route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt1.png" alt="" height="438" width="600"><br>
<br>
The waypoint west of the islet is #2. We mark this in "Route 
Properties", from the right-click menu. The Button "Split Route" is 
highlighted, meaning it is available to use. This is exactly what we 
want to do, so we click the button and split the route at wpt #2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt2.png" alt="" height="245" width="600"><br>
<br>
Right click at #2 and choose "Append Waypoint",<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt3.png" alt="" height="429" width="600"><br>
<br>
Move the cursor to the first triangle, and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Then move the cursor to the second triangle , and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Same thing for the original wpt to the east of the islet.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt4.png" alt="" height="114" width="600"><br>
<br>
Click "Activate Route" to see that this extension worked.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt5.png" alt="" height="435" width="600"><br>
<br>
Once again mark  "Route Properties" in the right-click dialog. #3 is the
 last wpt in our "new" temporary route. The "Extend Route" button is 
highlighted, so we click it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt6.png" alt="" height="361" width="600"><br>
<br>
Open the Route Manager to view the result. Notice the naming of the 
routes. _B_plus is active. What remains is to delete route _B and to 
rename _B_plus to a suitable name, for example the name of your original
 route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt7.png" alt="" height="172" width="600"><br>
<br>
Deleting route _B.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt8.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
And here is the finally adjusted route.<br>
<br>
This was just an exercise.....in real life, it would be easier to just 
move the existing waypoints in the route, to avoid the Islet.<br>

OpenCPN can import optimized routes from the Free and OpenSource QtVlm 
program. Make yourself familiar with QtVlm if you intend to use it, as 
many things are done differently from OpenCPN.</p>
QtVlm <a href="http://wiki.virtual-loup-de-mer.org/index.php/QtVlm/en">Documentation and Installation</a> <br>

<br>
<img src="images/qtvlm1.png" alt="" height="115" width="400"><br>
<br>
Once a route is created, the option "Copy" will be available in the right-click menu.<br>
The option dialog above pops up when pressing "Copy".<br>
<br>
Before going any further, make sure you really <strong>understand grib files</strong>, what they are and their limitations. A good place to start is <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Using-Gribs-And-Other-Objective-Forecasts">Franks Singletons pages.</a><br>
<br>
Let's look at an example of importing an optimized route from QtVlm. 
It's a situation most of us try to avoid. Going across the Bay of Biscay
 with an active Atlantic Low just west of the British Isles.<br>
The busy, time constrained, delivery skipper intend to find the best 
route from Lizard Point to Cape Finisterre. He has entered into QtVlm, 
the constraint, to route away from more than 30 kts headwinds. Below is 
the QtVlm optimized route based on the latest available grib file. Note 
that QtVlm doesn't know anything about tidal streams, currents local 
squalls nor about the state of the crew etc. These are more reasons why 
the final route always is the responsibility of the skipper.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Routing1.png" alt="" height="590" width="600"><br>
<br>
Right-click on the route and export in the kml format.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Routing2.png" alt="" height="335" width="500"><br>
<br>
Open OpenCPN. Right-click and "Paste Route"<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Routing3.png" alt="" height="487" width="500"><br>
<br>
This looks a bit ugly, and both the route and all waypoint have been exported.<br>
We want somthing better!<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Routing5.png" alt="" height="516" width="600"><br>
<br>
One alternative is to let QtVlm (Edit Route) "Simplify" the route before copying.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/routing6.png" alt="" height="731" width="600"><br>
<br>
 Another alternative is to first use the "Paste Track" option.<br>
<br>
*Note that this is no true track, it's just another way of exporting a 
route, possible due to the KML format. A track describes where we have 
been in the past, while routing is planning for the future. Importing 
the track gives a "light-weight" overview of the suggested route. Read 
more about the <a href="#GribWeatherPlugin"><em>Grib Weather Plugin</em></a><em>.</em><br>
<br>
<img src="images/Routing7.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
Next open OpenCPNs Route Manager Track Tab and press "Route from Track".<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Routing8.png" alt="" height="638" width="600"><br>
<br>
Much better. We now have a track with a route on top. Right-click and delete the track.<br>
Next, it is smart to display the same gribfile, used by QtVlm, in OpenCPN, using the Grib Plugin.<br>
<br>
All this looks impressive, but it's still based on a grib file. So it's 
still based on a computer prognosis, with no human input. All other 
reservations connected with gribs, still applies. An on board calibrated
 barometer is a good way to check what confidence can put on a grib 
forecast. Read more about the  <a href="#GribWeatherPlugin"><em>Grib Weather Plugin</em></a><br>
A reasonable polar diagram is essential as well. Producing one is 
standard procedure on racing boats, but not that common on cruising 
boats. Cruising specific factors, such as "comfort" also plays a part in
 a cruisers true performance capabilities.<br>

<strong>S57 Vector Charts and the CM93 ver2 charts.</strong><br>
All charts display the Dawn/Dusk and Night levels. This means that there
 is no change when the button is first pressed, but further pressing 
brings up a Dusk and then a Night palette.<br>
<strong>US Raster Charts</strong><br>
These works the same as the vector-charts.<br>
<strong>Other Raster Charts</strong><br>
Most other raster charts just contains a standard palette, and pressing 
the Button has no effect other than dimming part of OpenCPN, except for 
the chart display.<br>
The Brazilian Raster Charts includes a dusk and night palette, but the colors displayed is not what one would expect.<br>
Charts converted with the help of libbsb,tiff2bsb and imgkap, normally only contains the standard color scheme for daylight.<br>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_lector"><strong>Caveat lector</strong></a><br>
There is absolutely no guarantee that a correction, based on one point, 
 as described below, will be valid for the whole chart cell. Be very  
careful when using this feature.<br>
<br>
Starting with offsets.
<ul>
    <li>Go to single chart (i.e. non-quilted) mode, with cm93 charts displayed. Use F9 to flip quilting on and off</li>
    <li>Zoom/Pan to the region of interest.</li>
    <li>Right click and activate "CM93 Offset Dialog"</li>
</ul>
  <img src="images/cm93.png" alt="" border="20" height="304" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="294"><br>
<ul>
    <li>In the list of cells/MCOVR IDs, selected the one MCOVR of 
interest.    The coverage area for this MCOVR object will be outlined 
with a heavy  yellow border.</li>
    <img src="images/offsets2.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
    <br>
    <li>Some cells have built in corrections already applied. The values
 wgsox and wgsoy, are offsets to bring the original chart cell to WGS84.
 See the first and third cell in the picture above. The values are for 
information only, and cannot be changed. These corrections are generally
 correct, but not always. Sometimes the corrections are wrong and 
sometimes there are no corrections where there ought to be. This is 
where this manual offset feature comes in handy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In order to use this feature effectively, one needs a geographically  
known reference point.  As an example, say there is a NAVAID present on 
 the chart  cell with known WGS84 lat &amp; long, as from a light list. 
 In this case, one  can drop a waypoint on the chart, edit the waypoint 
properties to the  known lat/lon, and then use the CM93 Offset Dialog to
 slew the  cell/MCOVR so that the dropped waypoint coincides with the 
NAVAID  feature on the cm93 cell (chart).<br>
<br>
You may also use a geographical feature such as a Cape or point whose  
location is absolutely known, as by reference to observation, or by  
rendering on another, more accurate chart such as a trusted scanned  
raster chart or georeferenced photo chart.<br>
<br>
To see how this feature works, here is an example from the South Pacific.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/offsets4.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
This is Tongareva, also called Penhryn atoll. A mark, with a triangle is dropped at the westernmost point of the Island.<br>
<img src="images/offsets5.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Zooming
 out to next smaller scale chart makes the triangle mark jump NNE. Time 
for some corrections, as we, at least for the purpose of this example, 
are confident that the larger scale chart is correct.<br>
<img src="images/offsets6.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Quite large corrections brings the chart into reasonable agreement.  <br>
<ul>
    <li>Use the spin controls on the right side of the dialog to adjust 
the desired user offsets. It is also possible to write numbers directly.
 Notice that positive corrections is towards North and East.</li>
    <li>In some cases it is not clear exactly which M_COVR ID that 
represents your position. A simple test will reveal if a mark reacts to 
(large) corrections.</li>
    <li>The offsets are automatically saved in the binary MCOVR cache files found in the program data directory as CM93/...</li>

  <h1 id="AnchorWatch" class="book-heading">Anchor Watch</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><h2 id=""> </h2>
Anchor watch can be set on any mark that you have created with OpenCPN, 
except for a mark that belongs to a layer, as long as the boat is within
 1 nautical mile of this mark. This means that the Anchor watch items, 
on the right click menu, will only be visible if  your boat is within 1 
nautical miles of a mark. If the boat is closer than 5 m to the mark the
 anchor watch can't be set either.<br>
  A maximum of two marks can have anchor watch set at the same time. Get
 around the restriction with a mark in a layer, by creating a new mark 
nearb<em>y.</em>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="images/anch.png" alt="" height="354" width="400"></p>
This feature can be used in other situations than just anchoring, but 
keeping an eye on your anchor, and making sure it isn't dragging, is the
 main purpose. <br>
<br>
<strong>Basic usage</strong><br>
<br>
To learn how it works let's make a dry run to a nice trade wind anchorage.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch2.png" alt="" height="399" width="400"></div>
<br>
After circling around and exploring the bay, we know where we want to drop our anchor.<br>
At  the chosen spot we drop the anchor, at the same time we right click on the "Own Boat Icon" and press "drop Mark Here".<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch3.png" alt="" height="393" width="400"></div>
<br>
The wind, ENE at 15 kts let us drift back until we are satisfied with 
our scope. A burst in reverse convinces us that the anchor is set, later
 confirmed by a leisurely snorkeling over the anchor. Time to sort out 
the anchor watch<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"> </div>
<br>
Right click on the mark and press "Set Anchor Watch". The name of the 
mark changes to 50, and a green circle appears with a radius of 50 
meters.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch4.png" alt="" height="404" width="400"></div>
<br>
The anchor watch is now active, with a default max distance of 50m from 
the mark, and an alarm will be set off if the boat for some reason exits
 the circle. If "Play sound on CPA/TCPA Alerts" is set in the AIS 
ToolBox Tab, the  same audio alarm is activated together with the visual
 alarm on the  screen. To deactivate the anchor watch, right click on 
the mark and select "Clear Anchor Watch".<br>
<br>
If you are more than 50 m from the anchor when activating the watch this happens..<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch8.png" alt="" height="400" width="400"></div>
<br>
Sort this out by open the Mark/WP Properties Dialog.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch9.png" alt="" height="560" width="326"></div>
<br>
Change the name from "50 m" to a name that is relevant to the amount of 
chain and/or rode that you use, for example "75". Change the icon to, if
 you like. Pressing OK should stop the alarm.<br>
<br>
To get protection from the wind and a bit of northerly swell, we have 
really anchored to close to the beach. To keep an eye on this potential 
danger we set another mark on the beach.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch5.png" alt="" height="404" width="400"></div>
<br>
This time we change the "Mark Name" to -150, this means that if the boat
 comes within 150 meters of this mark, the alarm is set off. Green 
circle, OK to be inside. Red circle OK to be outside.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/Anch6.png" alt="" height="399" width="400"></div>
<br>
An hour later, after a heavy squall passed, the wind goes light and 
fluky. The boat drifts towards the beach and the anchor alarm sounds and
 comes up on our computer screen. <br>
The alarm sound is the same as the AIS warning sound and is set in the ToolBox under the AIS tab.<br>
<br>
<strong>Alternatives and Settings</strong><br>
A mark can also be created by hitting "Enter" or "Ctrl + M". The mark 
will be created at the position of the cursor. The anchor watch can now 
be set as demonstrated above with the default alarm distance being 
applied.<br>
<br>
A way to easily drop a mark, exactly at your current position, is to hit
 "Ctrl + Space". This is the "Man Over Board" shortcut. Right click and 
go to properties. Change the name to a suitable alarm distance and pick a
 different icon. Set the Anchor Watch.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="images/aa-mob.png" alt="" height="260" width="300"></div>
<div><br>
The picture is an illustration to what happens if you use the MOB 
keystroke, and then just activate the Anchor Watch. As the mark is 
already named, the default watch distance doesn't work. The green circle
 is the 5 m default minimum distance. The alarm goes off, of course.</div>
<br>
Both the default Anchor Watch Radius and Max distance  from mark can be 
changed by editing the configuration file, opencpn.ini on Windows and 
opencpn.config on Linux. <br>
Close down OpenCPN and open the configuration file in a text editor.<br>
Find the section that starts with "[Settings] ".<br>
Create two new lines, looking, for example like this.<br>
AnchorWatchDefault=45        (default is 50 m)<br>
AnchorWatchMax=2500         (default is 1852 m) <br>
Enter your own preferences, 45 &amp; 2500 are just for illustration.<br>
<br>

  <h1 id="AutomaticAnchorMark" class="book-heading">Automatic Anchor Mark</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --> <br>
Automatic Anchor Mark.  This is what it does:<br>
If the following are ALL true:<br>
1. In "Cruising" mode, meaning that speed has at some point exceeded 3.0 kts.<br>
2. Current speed is less than 0.5 kts.<br>
3. OpenCPN has been up at least 30 minutes<br>
4. OpenCPN is exiting normally<br>
5. There is no anchor watch set on an "anchor..." icon mark.<br>
6. Any "Anchorage - icon" waypoint within 0.25 NM of current GPS location is deleted.<br>
<br>
Then, OpenCPN will drop a waypoint at the current location, with the name - "Anchorage created on [Date Stamp]".<br>
<br>
Thus waypoints are automatically created for known good anchorages as you shut down the computer. <br>
The 0.25 NM condition prevents clogging up frequently visited anchorages with closely spaced waypoints.  <br>
The other conditions help to prevent spurious waypoints. <br>
<br>
<br>
To use this feature find opencpn.conf or opencpn.ini as it is called in windows.<br>
Search for a line like this:<br>
AutoAnchorDrop=0<br>
and change the value from "0" to "1".<br>

  <h1 id="NavigationDataBackup" class="book-heading">Navigation Data Backup</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --> A rotating backup of navobejcts is created on every program run. OpenCPN keeps backups of the last 5 runs. This can be changed.<br>
In the opencpn.ini/opencpn.config file you can find a configuration 
setting to control the number of backups kept, defaulting to <b>KeepNavobjBackups=5. </b>This value can be changed using a text editor.<br>
The backups are then stored in files navobj.xml.[1..x] (in the same 
directory as the ni file) where .1 is  always the newest backup and the 
oldest is removed on the next program  run. The file that will be loaded
 on next start is called navobj.xml.<br>
To load an old backup, exit the program. Find the backup you want to use. Rename it  navobj.xml. Start OpenCPN!<br>
<br>
<strong>If trouble strikes...</strong><br>
You have useful automatic rolling backups of navobj.xml, as described above.<br>
<strong>Copy them somewhere safe</strong> before you run OpenCPN again, 
as they are automatically rolled over, and you lose the oldest one for 
each invocation of OpenCPN.<br>
Rename the "best" one as navobj.xml, and the contents will be automatically used by OCPN.<br>
<br>
The OpenCPN logfile also serves as a backup through the "LOGBOOK:" entries.<br>
These can be used to reconstruct a  GPX track. A windows utility for hat purpose ia available here: <a href="https://github.com/nohal/LogBookExtractor/downloads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nohal/LogBookExtractor/downloads</a><br>
<br>
<strong>Long term backup</strong><br>
The navobj.xml.[1..x] takes care of your session data backup. This means
 that when you start OpenCPN it "remembers" the state of your last 
session. <br>
For a more permanent solution, to keep routes, waypoints and tracks etc,
 that you may need in the future, consider saving the data to <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/the_route_manager"><em>a "gpx" file</em></a> or <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/the_route_manager#layers"><em>use layers.</em></a><br>

Download Plugins</h3>
Go to the dedicated page for downloading plugins: <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a><br>
 
<h3 id="InstallingaPlugin">Installing a Plugin</h3>
For<strong> Linux</strong>, place the downloaded "pluginxx.so" in 
{prefix}/lib/opencpn, which means /usr/local/lib/opencpn for a standard 
installation, using the provided packages.<br>
For <strong>Windows</strong> place the downloaded "pluginxx.dll" in a 
"plugins" subfolder of your OpenCPN installation folder. A common 
location is C:\Program Files\OpenCPN\plugins.<br>
Once the plugin is in the right directory, restart OpenCPN and proceed to enabling the plugin.<br>
For <strong>Mac </strong>right-click your app in Finder and open "Contents", and put your plugin in the "PlugIns" directory.<br>
 
<h3 id="EnablingaPlugin">Enabling a Plugin</h3>
Plugins are made available by clicking on the plugin in the 
Options-&gt;Plugin Tab. Once this is done, an "Enable" button appears. 
Pressing this button activates the plugin icon in the ToolBar. Not all 
plugins has an icon when active. For most plugins there is a 
"Preferences" Button for configuration.<br>
When a plugin is disabled in the Options-&gt;Plugin tab, the plugin Icon disappears from the ToolBar.<br>
The Plugin Icon works as a toggle switch for the plugin. Pressing the 
Grib Icon, for example, activates the Grib plugin. Pressing one more 
time, kills it.<br>
The WMM Icon uses a new feature, by displaying the magnetic variation, at the position of OwnShip in the button itself.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The Dashboard pluging is able to show 
quite a few instruments. If the data is available to OpenCPN in the 
NMEA0183 data stream the different instruments will display relevant 
data. But...the plugin don't tell what is available. It is assumed that 
the user know what is connected. It is of course possible to activate 
all instruments and see what works.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Dashboard in action, two Dashboards, one vertical and one 
horizontal. Grab the top Caption bar with the cursor and drag the 
Dashboard as far as possible to the right or left. Let go the cursor, 
and the Dashboard will dock, the chart display will adjust, no part of 
the chart will be hidden. Horizontal Dashboards can in a similar way be 
docked top or bottom.<br>
This process is reversible. Just grab the Dashboard dialog bar with the 
cursor, an pull towards the middle of the screen, and the Dashboard will
 become floating.<br>

<h2 id="WindHistory">Wind History</h2>
<br>
The Wind History Instrument needs some further explanations.<br>
<br>
The "wind history" instrument is meant to be run as a standalone (vertical) instrument.<br>
Just define a separate dashboard and add it as the only instrument.<br>
<br>

<br>
You can  resize the Instrument it with the mouse.<br>

<br>
In real conditions, it monitors around 40 min of wind direction (red), 
as well as wind speed (blue), showing a vertical time line every 5 min 
(the example screen shot is a full-speed VDR replay).<br>
<br>
The text on the top shows the current values, as it is displayed in the 
standard instruments (blue = wind speed data, TWS=True Wind Speed, red =
 direction, TWD = True Wind Direction).<br>
<br>
Here is an explanation of the text line, left side (see screen shot):<br>
TWS 7.5 : true Wind Speed currently 7.5 kts<br>
Max 22.3 kts since 18:50 : this is the max Wind speed in the visible graphs, i.e. the last ~40 mins<br>
Overall 22.3 : the max wind speed since OpenCPN was started.<br>
<br>
Right side above :<br>
TWD 357° : True wind direction currently 357°<br>
<br>
The thin red/blue curves are the real direction/speed values, the 
thicker curves are smoothed values. Makes it easier to see trends.<br>
<br>
There is some logic included :<br>
The instruments re-zoomes automatically as much as possible, always trying to show the whole visible curve;<br>
Wind speed curve:<br>
if your max (visible) wind speed is 10 kts, then your scale is from 0...11 kts (rounded upwards to the next full knot).<br>
In the screen shot we had a mx of 22.3kts --&gt; scale is 0...23 kts.<br>
Wind direction :<br>
The instrument scale shows +/- 90° of the currently visible data values, but is limited to a total of 360°.<br>
If the wind is shifting through North (from 350, 355, 359, 002, 010, 
...) we're shifting the curve as well, meaning that there is NO vertical
 jump in the data from 360° --&gt; 0°, and we do NOT loose all the 
continuity in the smoothed curves !<br>
<br>
If you should happen to have more than a full 360° cycle of wind 
direction in the recorded data (if you sail through a couple of dust 
devils ), I limited the max scale to 360°, meaning that the curve will 
run out of the visible area on bottom or on top of the instrument.<br>
<br>
Please note that you don't have to have the instrument "open" all the time.<br>
Once activated as initially described, you can close it, and simply 
reopen it on demand. You don't loose the curves, the instrument 
continues to collect the data.<br>
To make it visible again simply right click on an existing  standard-dashboard, and click the "Wind History" Dashboard.<br>

  <h1 id="GribWeatherPlugin" class="book-heading">Grib Weather Plugin</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->OpenCPN has a lightweight grib weather
 file viewer plugin, with a limited set of features, aimed at being 
useful while under way. It is not possible to download grib files from 
within OpenCPN. Many external sources for grib files are available on 
the Internet.  <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Grib-Files-Getting-And-Using">Franks-Weather </a> is a good starting point.<br>
<ul>
    <li>To display grib files as an overlay on your normal charts you have to first activate the grib icon <img src="images/grib.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"></li>
    <li>Go to <img src="images/settings_003.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"> find the plugin tab. Click on the Grib plugin, then the "Enable" button. The "Preferences" Button brings up a small dialog. <br>
    <p><img src="images/grig-plug.png" alt="" height="324" width="600"></p>
    </li>
    <li>Tick the "Use High Definition Graphics" box as well, unless you 
are on old hardware. Not ticking the "High Definition Graphics" box can 
help to speed up the grib display, in such cases.</li>
    <li><img src="images/grib2.png" alt="" height="663" width="650"></li>
    <li>The Next step is to click the icon, which brings up the Grib 
Display Control. Use the upper part of this window to navigate to, and 
select your grib files. The grib files will then be appear in the 
control. See picture above.</li>
    <li>Click on the "&gt;" in front of the grib file. The individual 
forecasts contained in the grib file, is then displayed under the grib 
file heading.</li>
    <li>Click on one of the forecasts and it will be displayed. When you
 move the cursor over the grib display, the values for wind etc will be 
displayed for the cursor position, in the lower part of the "Grib 
Display Control". Here you can select what grib values to view. Note 
that not all grib files contains wave data.</li>
    <li>When zoomed in to show just a small area of the chart, there may
 not be any wind-arrows visible. The relevant data will, however, still 
be displayed in the grib dialog. To see the wind arrows zoom out to view
 a larger area.</li>
    <li>The gribs are only displayed on the charts when the "Grib Display Control" dialog is open.</li>
    <li>For certain areas gribfiles describing currents are available</li>
    <li><img src="images/cur1_0.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="492" width="650"></li>

<ul>
    <li>If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you 
understand the basics, before you start to use them. It is essential to 
understand the limitations of weather forecasts in the grib format. It 
is also worth pointing out that gribs are <strong>not</strong> reliable near tropical systems, at least not when using gribs based on the very common GFS model.</li>

    <li><strong>Where is my log file? </strong><strong>Where is my config.ini file?</strong> Read this explanation - <a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></li>
    <li><strong>I can't find all those files you are talking about</strong>.
 A big contributing factor to this problem is that Windows default 
settings hides system files, and also by default, don't show file 
extensions. These settings can be changed however. In XP go to My 
Computer -&gt;Tools -&gt; Folder Options -View. Mark "Show hidden files 
and folders" and untick the box "Hide extensions for known file types". 
Other versions of Windows are similar, but may not be exactly like this.
 Now you should find the files we talked about in the previous 
paragraph. </li>
    <li><strong>I have a problem so I reinstalled - but that did not help. </strong>Try this approach instead - <a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></li>
    <li><strong>My charts used to show up just fine in OpenCPN, but using 3.0.2 and later, they no longer work.</strong>
 OpenCPN used to display charts with an unknown projection as a Mercator
 chart. This is no longer the case. If OpenCPN don't recognize the chart
 projection, it will not be displayed. Potentially seirous errors are 
thus avoided. The event is logged in the opencpn.log.  Users may run 
into problems if a chart projection is stated as "UNKNOWN" even though 
it really is a prefect Mercator chart. Unfortunately, some conversion 
tools take a shortcut and don't enter the "PR" tag in the 
kap-chart-header correctly. The projection of a chart can always be 
found, and the "PR=UNKNOWN" should always be avoided. Official charts 
that OpenCPN really can't display, with a latitude &lt; 70 degrees 
north/south, are very few indeed. Really only a handful of legacy, 
Gnomonic, large scale charts.</li>
    <li><strong>I get a lot of error messages when starting OpenCPN from the Linux command line. </strong>   Messages like (opencpn:8979): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_drawable_get_size: assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE (drawable)' failed<br>
    (opencpn:8979): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_drawable_get_depth: assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE (drawable)' failed<br>
    Error opening coefficient file<br>
    (opencpn:8979): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_window_get_origin: assertion `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed<br>
    are quite normal an has nothing to do with OpenCPN. Just ignore them.</li>
    <li><strong>Why does it take so long time to load vector charts?    </strong><br>
    The behavior you see is expected for ENC charts. ENCs must be 
converted to internal SENC format before use for navigation. This takes a
 little bit of time, depending on your system capabilities. But it only 
has to be done once, and the converted SENCs are stored on your system 
for later use.<br>
    All ECS systems must convert ENCs to SENCs. Some take longer, (like 
OpenCPN), so that subsequent access is faster. Some convert faster, 
leaving more work to do at the time of actual chart display. Its a 
design decision. OpenCPN is optimized for speed in real use, not for 
speed in conversion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What are all those 'U' things all over my chart?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature being rendered is S57 Text relating to 'M_QUAL'.</p>
<p>This is a meta-object describing the quality of data shown. The 
Attribute of interest is CATZOC, or "Category of Zone of Confidence". 
The value on most US ENC's is "6", or "un-assessed". Thus, the 'U'.</p>
<p>You can turn this symbol off in OpenCPN by de-selecting the box next 
to M_QUAL in 'Tool Box' / 'Vector Charts' tab 'Mariners Standard' 
selection list box.<br>
Unticking the box "Meta Objects" also hides the "U" symbols.</p>
<p>To learn the acronyms used in this application search the S57 'Object and Attribute' catalog at: <a href="http://www.s-57.com/" title="http://www.s-57.com/">http://www.s-57.com/</a></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>I have routes and way points in Sea Clear and I would like to import them into OpenCPN. Can I do it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. I had originally created and maintained all my routes and 
waypoints in SeaClear, exported them, loaded them into GPSUtility (for 
Windows) and saved them as text files.</p>
<p>To import into OpenCPN  I opened all my text files (routes and 
waypoints) with GPSUtility, saved that out as one big gpx file, and 
loaded it into OpenCPN. Works like a champ.</p>
<p>I've edited them and saved them back out as GPX files with no trouble.</p>
<p>Individual routes can be edited and saved in appropriately named GPX files.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Whenever I try to open a particular chart OpenCPN crashes. What's going on?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are the chart file is corrupted. Note the name and number of 
the suspect chart and replace it with a fresh download. Read the log 
file that may contain relevant information regarding the chart. 
Sometimes the bad chart blocks OpenCPN from restarting. Follow these 
instructions instead - <a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></p>

    <h3 id="I'm using Linux/Ubuntu and I hear no sound"><strong><a name="#"></a>I'm using Linux/Ubuntu and I hear no sound</strong></h3>
    </li>
</ul>
Upgrade to 3.2. The sound problem was solved in Beta 3.1.1224, and should just work.<br>
The PortAudio sound libraries are included i OpenCPN and provides full ALSA support.<br>
Sound on Windows and Mac are not changed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Background</strong><br>
The earlier implementation of Linux sounds is described below. It was a  mess.<br>
OpenCPN uses a simple sound feature available in wxWidgets, wxSound, 
that uses OSS (Open Sound System) to play sounds. If OSS is not 
available, SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) will be used instead. It has 
no support for ALSA!<br>
With version 11.04, Ubuntu dropped the OSS support and the OpenCPN "sound problem", started <br>
OSS is replaced with ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) on newer 
Linux distributions, and Ubunt. This is for good reasons. AlSA replaced 
OSS about 10 years ago!<br>
Similarly the libwxgtk2.8-0, that OpenCPN relies on, is not compiled 
with support for SDL in the Ubuntu version. The same applies to many 
other Linux distributions.  This is the core of the sound problem, when 
using OpenCPN on Linux.<br>
<br>
How to get sound to work?<br>
There are a few options available. Starting with the easiest......<br>
<br>
1.  "aoss" is a "wrapper program" that catches OSS sound and 
"translates" it to the default ALSA sound system.  Ubuntu does not 
install "aoss" by default, but can be added using "sudo  apt-get install
 alsa-oss".<br>
To use "aoss" just start OpenCPN from the command line like this:<br>
$aoss opencpn<br>
To make it easier, write a shell script containing the single line 
above, and make it executable. Change the link (icon) where you normally
 start OpenCPN, to point to the new script.<br>
<br>
2 "padsp" works  similar to "aoss", using the "pulseaudio server". It's 
available when the "pulseaudio-utils" package is installed. To get sound
 in OpenCPN start this way from the command line:<br>
$padsp opencpn<br>
Of course, this can be scripted as well, as for "aoss".<br>
<br>
3. Install a version of libwxgtk that includes support for SDL. Such versions are available from <a href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists" title="http://apt.wxwidgets.org">http://apt.wxwidgets.org</a>. OpenCPN 3.0.x requires the minimum version of  ibwxgtk2.8-0 to be minimum. 2.8.12, for all features to work as expected.<br>
Download the correct package for your version of Debian or Ubuntu.  
Unfortunately the latest Ubuntu versions are not included, but 
"squeeze"(strictly a Debian package) is a good candidates. Goto <a href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/">apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/</a>, and select 32 or 64 bits version. For example, the latest 64 bits package is <a href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/binary-amd64/libwxgtk2.8-0_2.8.12.1-0_amd64.deb">apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/binary-amd64/libwxgtk2.8-0_2.8.12.1-0_amd64.deb</a><br>
Download and then<br>
$sudo dpkg -i ibwxgtk2.8XXXXXX (the proper name of the downloaded version), to install from the command line.<br>
Alternatively, simply clicking on the package is enough on many Linuxes.<br>
In both cases you may have to force "upgrade" to a lower version than the existing package, depending on your installation.<br>
<br>
Once you have installed wxgtk with support for SDL, as described above, 
open Synaptic, find the installed package. Mark it an then goto 
"Package" and tick the "Lock Version" box. This is to prevent that your 
newly installed wxgtk will be replaced by a version with a higher 
version, that lacks support for SDL.<br>
Do not try to update your system from the command-line, as "apt-get" will not respect the "Lock".<br>
<br>
4. You can also recompile libwxgtk and include support for SDL. Not for the faint of heart.<br>
<br>
5. It is possible to compile your own kernel and include support for 
OSS, but this solution is not for the faint of heart either. <br>
<br>

<ul>
    <li><strong>OpenCPN and Great Circle Navigation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Raster charts display bearings and headings as straight, measurable 
lines on the chart. Similarly, Vector ENC's are rendered as Mercator 
projections in OpenCPN and most other ECS's for the same reason.</p>
<p>For typical coastal navigation, errors which occur using rhumb line 
instead of great circle calculations are small for the distances usually
 covered by one chart.</p>
<p>Mercator Charts and Mercator navigation is the standard for most 
navigational purposes. Other terms used instead of "Mercator Sailing" is
 "Loxodrome Sailing" or "Rhumb Line Sailing".</p>
<p>OpenCPN uses Mercator Sailing and cannot directly display Great 
Circles, but through GPX route import , Great Circle Routes can be used 
as explained on <a href="#PlanningData"><em>Planning Data</em></a> page in the wiki. There is also a plugin available as well as some <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/node/133">Supplementary Software</a>  to handle great Circles.<br>
<strong>The next stable version of OpenCPN 3.2.0 will handle Great Circles directly</strong>. This feature is available for testing in the beta development as of version 3.1.814.<br>
There is also a Routing Plugin with GreatCircle capabilities available for download.</p>

<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
 share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
 make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public 
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and 
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free 
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
 License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
 be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
 the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers 
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means 
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is 
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is 
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute 
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. <br>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
 or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
 to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the 
terms of this License. <br>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
 the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
 appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
 else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user 
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
 interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
 based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) <br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
 can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
 the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
 License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, <br>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
 give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
 performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
 corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange; or, <br>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
Subsection b above.) <br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
 means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special 
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
 the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the 
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise 
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
 who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will 
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
 its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
 so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
 any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who 
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
 could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely 
from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
 by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
 the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
 Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the 
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the 
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
 DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey 
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.<br>
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author<br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br>
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2<br>
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details<br>
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome<br>
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' <br>
for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
 you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright<br>
interest in the program `Gnomovision'<br>
(which makes passes at compilers) written <br>
by James Hacker.<br>

<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you 
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications 
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser 
General Public License instead of this License.<!-- google_ad_section_end -->  </div>
